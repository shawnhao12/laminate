The memory is cloaked in a web of blackened synapses, lying at the very edge of the abyss that you recognize as your short term memory, but fragments do come through.  You&#39;re seated upon a plush bench seat, hand pressed to the glass of the capsule roaring downward towards a planet that stretches beyond the horizon.  Far less convenient than landing directly, but you know that isn&#39;t possible.  Men defied the Gods of the this world once, but do so again at their own peril.  This is the only way.

[[Strange...where am I?-&gt;Where am I?]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="4" name="Where am I?" tags="" position="481,467" size="100,100">&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/NGiox2N.png&quot; width=&quot;75%&quot; height=&quot;75%&quot;&gt;

Your eyes open, as your mind grapples with a question so fundamental.  The world is bleary but the data comes in, sharpening with every passing second.  A ceiling.  You&#39;re staring at a pristine white ceiling, the inner portion recessed, swirling etchings defining the boundary.  The headache persists but your body doesn&#39;t register the same problems, and tries to rise.  Only to fail, muscles suddenly straining.  Through the lingering fog of your mind you look down, and the situation becomes clearer.

You&#39;re laying on a bed, the sheets smooth and glossy, nothing like the silk and satins you&#39;re more familiar with.  *Nude*.  From your toes to the flare of your waist, up past a pert chest.  And you&#39;re bound, arms and legs spread by the chains linking each to the corner posts of the bed.

[[Consider the situation further.-&gt;The Mirror]]
[[Forget that, struggle!]]
[[Scream!]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="5" name="The Mirror" tags="" position="330,618" size="100,100">Instead of further physical efforts, your rational mind asserts itself.  First things first: you //really// give your situation proper examination.

Some of the details you already know.  You&#39;re on a bed with peculiar, slick sheets.  They&#39;re white, same as the ceiling above.  And you&#39;re bound at wrist and ankle by simple cuffs.

Looking around, the rest of the room shows a similar decor-- clean lines, smooth surfaces, a strictly modern aesthetic.  An endtable beside the bed features a projected clock against the wall, reading &#39;&#39;GOOD MORNING&#39;&#39;.  Several other items rest there but they&#39;re above your head, only vaguely visible.

It&#39;s the mirror visible across from the foot of the bed that truly gives perspective.  In its silvered visage you see yourself, a woman bound lewdly upon the bed.  Your hair is long and blonde, well-kept but disheveled, falling across your shoulders and down your back.  A gag is visible as well, the white material covering the space from nose to chin like a panel.  Between your teeth, the presence of a ball being lodged beneath is obvious.  You&#39;re quite literally bound and gagged, all but helpless-- for a designated length of time, you realize.  Hidden from your eyes, but visible in the reflection is a second projection from the endstand clock:

&#39;&#39;Binding Release: 12/45 hours remaining.&#39;&#39;

[[I&#39;ve been here for over a day?-&gt;Mirror II]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="6" name="Forget that, struggle!" tags="" position="480,619" size="100,100">Your senses may still be reeling from revelation, but your muscles know what to do.  Pulling hard, you struggle against the bindings keeping you upon the bed.  The chains rattle, your cuffs pull just a bit tighter, but then...

...nothing.  Despite your efforts, they do not give.  You&#39;re left panting, but do get a look at the d-shaped rings to which the chains have been attached, built into each of the bed posts.  A strange accessory, as if it were made for just this sort of situation.

[[Perhaps I should consider the situation.-&gt;The Mirror]]
[[Scream!]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="7" name="Scream!" tags="" position="631,618" size="100,100">A high-pitched scream forms in your chest, rises up your throat-- and dies in a muffled //mmmph// as you suddenly realize that the cuffs were not the only binding you wore.  Staring up at the ceiling you work your jaw, your tongue.  The gag is smooth and ball-shaped, seated just behind your teeth.  A further portion covers your mouth and wraps beneath your chin, a panel holding it in place.  You&#39;re limited to muffled moans, and nothing more.

[[I can still struggle!-&gt;Forget that, struggle!]]
[[Perhaps I should consider things.-&gt;The Mirror]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="8" name="Mirror II" tags="" position="330,766" size="100,100">It appears so.  You try to recall anything from that time period, but nothing comes.  It&#39;s as if you&#39;ve walked to the edge of the abyss, staring into an emptiness so vast, so terrifying.  What had happened?  How had you come to this?  //Who are you?//

That last bit at least pulls you back from the brink, escaping the inky darkness that proves to be only your //short// term memory.  Holes are punched in anything further back than perhaps a week, but beyond that answers do come when queried.  You&#39;re in your twenties, born on the colony of Urzan Tor IV.  Tor-Four, as the colloquialism went, had been the very backwater.  You had escaped to greener pastures as soon as you could pull together enough for a ticket, entering the service of Steris Trans-Galactic, a major research and development firm.  But you&#39;re hardly a scientist, no, you&#39;re what&#39;s known as a //prospector.//  Not of mineral deposits, mind you, but of breakthroughs and technologies tucked away on the fringes of known space.  With a hint of new frontiers and a suitcase, you&#39;ve been rising through the ranks by coming back with deeds and contracts for all sorts of new discoveries.  Even Backwaters like Tor-Four hold interesting things, after all, but it takes a prospector to bring them to market.  That&#39;s you.

[[Then how the hell did I end up like THIS?-&gt;Mirror III]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="9" name="Mirror III" tags="" position="330,917" size="100,100">//Torei.//

The name comes to you, but that&#39;s damn close to the black hole in your memories.  Infamous among spacers, and those with an interest in the fringes.  A lost world, only relatively recently put back on the map.  A perverse world, known for the intensive sexuality that was its culture and main export, as well as the presence of widespread slavery.  But a &#39;&#39;lucrative&#39;&#39; world, if one braved its dangers.  Torei&#39;s strange history had left it with biomedical technology perhaps centuries ahead of anything available on the market, and a distinct need for all sorts of foreign inventions in turn.  A prospector&#39;s dream, a whale of a catch, but terribly difficult to haul in.

Torei had a thriving tourist culture, and besides a strict ban on planetside landings (thus the need for a space elevator descent), meeting with the locals was easy enough.  Ringdoms circled the planet&#39;s equator, each a nation unto itself.  Culturally similar of course, but varying widely between the tradionalist and suspicious antipodes and those near the elevator, who welcomed outsiders with opened hands-- always willing to trade.  But Torei&#39;s humans did not hold the keys to their own planet, and they certainly did not offer much of their best tech.

That only came from the poles.  From the Gods.  Mazos and Dahom.

Far from civilization the twinned AIs ruled.  Some Toreans called them Gods, others merely machines.  Most fear them, and for good reason.  Torean history speaks at length to the time before liberty, where the AIs ruled and humans served, little more than nameless cogs in a planetary machine.  Endless suffering, torture, experimentation.  But everyone knew they were the absent Kings of Torei.  A majority of their subjects had escaped them, a war had ensued to confirm that fact, but they still held secrets.  Technology...

I came here to make a deal, that&#39;s clear.  [[My deal... it&#39;s with them?-&gt;Mirror IV]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="10" name="Mirror IV" tags="" position="331,1066" size="100,100">You may not remember much, but you do distinctly recall that you&#39;re not *that* foolish.  Certainly you remember researching the planet from afar, as best you could, only to determine it wasn&#39;t worth the effort-- until contacted directly.  How had they know of your interest?

That you can&#39;t fully remember.  Again you had trended close to the holes in your memory, and this time fallen through.  You distinctly recalled coming to the planet to make a deal, but the terms of it?  Your contact?  Gone.

And now you have a more immediate concern: 12 hours of bondage to look forward to, it seems.  That would clearly be unacceptable.  What if someone walked in?  Were you being held against your will?  You need answers.  You &#39;&#39;must&#39;&#39; escape.  But how?

Examining your bindings reveals them to be well constructed, solid pieces of work.  They&#39;re not locked, but you have so little movement you couldn&#39;t even begin to undo them without having a hand free.  Eyeing the d-rings holding your chains to the bed reveals one of them, that attached to your left hand cuff, to look a bit loose however.  Perhaps you could work it free?

The only other option is made apparent by the mirror, which allows you to both see yourself and the area around the bed itself.  There appears to be a remote of some sort lying on the ground on the right side of your bed.  It would take some time, and you don&#39;t know what it would accomplish, but the glossy sheet of the bed you&#39;re pinned to is quite heavy.  If bunched up and pushed off, perhaps it could hit the largest button visible along the top.

[[I will break that d-ring.-&gt;Ring I]]
[[I will try to get that button.-&gt;Button I]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="11" name="Ring I" tags="" position="255,1216" size="100,100">Your bindings are taut, the range of movement allowed to your limbs quite limited indeed.  But by shifting your wrist, swinging it between the tightest points of restraint, you are able to shift the ring back and forth.  The metal is strong, but the screws holding it to the bed appear loose-- they certainly move with each shift of your hand that you manage.

A few minutes of such work is rewarded by a fleck of steel falling away, but damn, this could take a long time.

[[Maybe I should try for the button?-&gt;Button I]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="12" name="Button I" tags="" position="406,1217" size="100,100">You&#39;ve settled on trying the button.  A quick test confirms your hypothesis: the topmost sheet of the bed is slick and smooth, but your bare skin can shift it.  With enough wriggling, it should bunch up towards your feet.  Then a strategically placed knee should send it over.  

It will take some time, though.  Perhaps struggling against your restraints would prove easier?

Her pencil skirt hugs wide hips, while a corset embraces her midsection, allowing a violet bodice that emerges above.  She&#39;s quite busty, and the purple material is semi-transparent, allowing a clear view of her pierced nipples.  
(set: $methelp to true)
At least you&#39;re //both// a bit exposed, you consider, nevertheless blushing as the servant glances about the room.  Considering your situation, her reaction is quite reserved-- she merely smiles brightly, hands clasping before her.  Her wrists are linked by a chain between them, you notice, and a thick collar encircles her throat.

&quot;I see you are engaging in an extended period of self-bondage,&quot; she notes, looking pointedly at the countdown projected on the wall.  &quot;Given that your checkout time approaches, that seems unfortunate.  I would hate to charge you additional fees.&quot;

Her smile suggests she would in fact enjoy that.

&quot;To properly ascertain your service needs, we will need to remove your gag.  I can do this, for a small fee of 20 credits.  Please lift your chin if this is acceptable.&quot;

&quot;Excellent,&quot; the servant grins.  &quot;The 20 credit charge will been added to your account.  Now, allow me to assist.&quot;

She approaches the side of the bed, placing one knee upon it to loom over you.  It&#39;s impossible to ignore her chest made so visible beneath the violet material.

Your gag is not locked, and removing it simply requires the necessary straps be undone.  Pulling it free, a trail of drool lingers from the ball to your tongue before it snaps.  Carefully the servant sets it aside, her gaze returning to you again.

Reaching up, she begins to undo your restraints, starting at your wrists.  Freed, you&#39;re able to begin pulling off the cuffs themselves as she moves to your ankles.  It takes only a few more moments for your ordeal to finally conclude.  

&quot;Done,&quot; the servant concludes, rising from the bed to press her hand against the clock controls atop the nightstand.  The self-unlock command rolls down to zero, then terminates in a flash of red.

&quot;Checkout time is less than an hour away,&quot; the servant continues.  &quot;Please collect your things and join me at the front counter when you are ready.&quot;

She does not linger, exiting through the only door.  You&#39;re left in her wake.  Naked, perhaps ashamed, but freed.

You move to the center of the room, turning in a slow circle as you look upon the scene of your short-term amnesia.  You&#39;re on Torei, you came here to make a deal-- that&#39;s pretty much all you know.  There has to be something here to fill in the gaps!

The room itself is as white and pristine as you saw from your vantage upon the bed.  Furnishings are few and far between, providing a slick, modern look.  It also helps make your search much easier, allowing those few things that did not belong to stick out all the more clearly.

Projected against the wall the clock still marked time, but your focus falls upon the four items below it.  All are small rectangular cards, splayed in a fan-like fashion, but that&#39;s where the similarities end.

The first is an Aekoran identification passcard, your own image printed upon the front.  Various identifying features are noted underneath, alongside an expiration date of late tonight.  It appears your time on Torei had been drawing to an end.  The most prominent component of the card, however, is the bright red lettering along the top: **FREEWOMB**.
(set: $Status to 1)(set: $showstatus to true)(set: $unlockdoor to true)
The second card is actually a ticket for an ascent of the planet&#39;s space elevator, the Way Up.  Prepaid, and dated for midnight tonight.  Only your name is listed.

The third is a hotel keycard, obviously linked to your room. It&#39;s broken in half, the holostrip along the back missing a good chunk.  By itself, this probably wouldn&#39;t work.

The final card is more of an enigma.  Rectangular and card like, the material is smooth and reflective.  There are no words, nothing besides a black expanse that encapsulated the entire thing.  Flipping it over, you recognize your own handwriting in a white pen:

*&#39;Tomorrow.  Dusk.  The deal is on.  I can&#39;t...&#39;*

The words seem to sit uneasily upon the card, droplets of ink upon a midnight pond.  And... is that movement?

Apparently you&#39;re staying at Diarch&#39;s Choice, a small hotel located on the outskirts of Grand Aekora, the capital of the Ringdom of Aekora.  Amenities include prompt room service, on-site complimentary Wardrobe devices, a wide selection of wines, and what&#39;s referred to as &#39;secure slave storage&#39;.

Mention of the Wardrobe machine at least perks your interest, even if the description confuses.  It appears to be a public closet of some sort?  At least it would improve upon your current nudity.

The large mirror reveals itself to be the television as well once the silvery facade fades, replaced instead by a news channel.  A primly dressed woman in glossy red form-fitting material smiles into the camera, a collar pulled tight around her throat boldly proclaiming her to be &#39;Property of TNN&#39;.

&quot;Welcome back to the Torean News Network,&quot; she greets, as bright and chipper as her outfit.  &quot;As always, my name is Anna Karis and these are your top stories for the Ringdom of Aekora.&quot;

The camera flickers, the canned introduction replaced by a recording of the same woman, sitting slightly differently.  It must be presumed they produce customized programs for each region of Torei.

&quot;The Prime Markets are once again trending towards a record year, as imports from the elevator-adjacent Ringdoms continue to increase.  First time indenture rates have increased by 3% among leading sectors, and forecasts expect the boom to only continue as travel to Torei expands further.&quot;

Holding it so that it wouldn&#39;t slip away, you open the door, revealing a chute of some sort-- and the charred end of the sleeve, where it had once undoubtedly been a full shirt.

You&#39;ve found a garbage chute, you realize quickly.  And probably the last evidence of your clothing.  Did someone burn your clothing?  Did you?  Why would you do that?

Natural aesthetics certainly help.  By any standard, you&#39;re quite beautiful.  High cheekbones, full lips, a nose upturned just //so.//  Your blonde hair is a bit all over the place, but the way it falls upon your shoulders and down your back remains alluring.  Your eyes are piercing as well, so very green.

And you&#39;re not hurt, of that you can be sure.  Checking your nude form over, you look for puncture marks, wounds, anything to explain your lost memories.  You find nothing, your skin smooth and unmolested.

The memory is cloaked in a web of blackened synapses, lying at the very edge of the abyss that you recognize as your short term memory, but fragments do come through.  You&#39;re seated upon a plush bench seat, hand pressed to the glass of the capsule roaring downward towards a planet that stretches towards the horizon.  Far less convenient then landing directly, but you know that isn&#39;t possible.  Men defied the Gods of the this world once, but do so again at their own peril.  This is the only way.

Equally obsidian letters rise, hardly visible until you turn the card, utilizing its own glossy reflection to view what had arisen from the depthless deep.  Words.

//356 Cross Street, Grand Aekora.  Dusk.//

The words linger, but only momentarily.  As readily as they had emerged, the letters eventually sink back into the abyss.  Running your finger over the surface of the black card returns only the sensation of a smooth surface, unblemished besides your own comparably uncivilized scrawl.  To call the experience eerie would be to understate the situation greatly.

And still nude.  Glancing back at your room, you know you were thorough.  Whatever clothes you had come to Torei with, they&#39;re gone.  Making for the front desk seems an obvious solution, if a bit embarrassing.  Given the planet&#39;s reputation, certainly your situation could not be unique.

You open the door and pass through, cards clutched in your hand.  The hallway outside maintains the clean aesthetic your room had demonstrated, but the color scheme had changed-- here purple dominates, the floor a dark shade, the carpeting below something akin to periwinkle.

On the other hand, the black card and your troubled white scrawl.  The card had given a date and place, that&#39;s obvious.  You&#39;re a prospector, this *must* have been the deal you came to make.  The contact you could not recall, a meeting scheduled to acquire the technology you traveled all this way to acquire.  But what of what you had written yourself?

*&#39;Tomorrow.  Dusk.  The deal is on.  I can&#39;t...&#39;*

A warning?  If only you could remember!  And what of the predicament you had awoken to?  Bound and gagged, perhaps by your own hand.

It&#39;s the packaging that&#39;s more intriguing, however.  *Mem-Burn*, it labels itself as you read the fine print aloud.  &quot;WARNING: active ingredients will cause memory loss ranging from temporary to permanent, depending on dose.  Use with CAUTION.&quot;

The package is empty, but at least one part of your mystery situation becomes clear.  This has to be why your short-term memory was little more than a gaping wound, black and empty, like a missing tooth.  Why would you have done this to yourself?  

(If: $unlockdoor is true)[It had to be tied to the collection of cards you had found upon the nightstand.

If you were expecting something akin to a closet, what you enter into leaves you sorely disappointed.  There are no shelves, no hangings racks with textiles and outfits.  Only a sterile room greets you, quite claustrophobic given how small it is, and reminding you a bit of a bathroom given the tiles on the walls and a drain visible on the floor.  Several of the tiles are oddly shaped, the gap between them and their neighbors larger.  On the far wall, a touch-screen panel flickers to life.

Passing through subjects you to natural light for the first time since your awakening, an experience that leaves you dazed and blinking.  Your eyes do eventually adapt, revealing a cozy room, complete with a woman seated behind a semi-transparent desk.

Turning around in the small, stall-like room, you reach for the stainless steel door handle... and it doesn&#39;t turn.

The display panel on the far wall momentarily changes, providing an explanation as you try not to panic: 

*Nudity detected.  Aekoran law requires all slaves and women of freewomb status meet basic decency considerations before departure.  Please explore this Wardrobe device&#39;s catalog at your convenience, and select a complimentary free design of your choice!*

The cheery message retreats, and you&#39;re left without much of a choice.

The screen displays a model wearing the selected outfit.  It&#39;s sleek, form-fitting, and rendered entirely in a material labeled as *laminate*.  Even in the simulated light, the design seems to sparkle with the metallic hues embedded in the glossy material.  Black gloves and ankle-high boots are visble as well, the later featuring five-inch stilleto heels.

The &#39;7-point&#39; descriptor from the previous menu is described as indicating the inclusion of seven black laminate bondage-ready accessories.  Two wrist cuffs, two bicep cuffs, two ankle cuffs, the belt around the waist, and a collar around the neck.

The suit is also clearly semi-transparent, the thickened black strip between the legs that contained a zipper providing a modicum of decency, but it&#39;s hard to imagine wearing something from throat to toes that covered *less.* 

Accessories are listed as a set of black wrist-gloves, five inch heeled stiletto boots, and the pictured upper body harness, waist belt, and thigh cuffs.  Those last three are marked as &#39;restraint ready&#39;.

The primary coloration is black, but Torean-script words are boldly emblazoned along the arms and thighs.  Translation indicates the name brand of a mid-tier Torean slave trading firm, as well as inviting others to &#39;submit to advert-wear to earn credits!&#39;  It appears terribly degrading.

Accesories are listed as the pictured corset, the design featuring &#39;real steel&#39; boning custom-measured to both fit the wearer and match brand requirements, as well as the pictured shoes.  Those are labeled as &#39;ballet&#39;, and are clearly of a design that would make even standing upright a challenge-- much less walking!

The screen displays several models wearing the selected outfit, their uniformity only broken by their individual physical proportions.  It&#39;s sleek, form-fitting, and rendered entirely in a material labeled as *laminate*.  Midnight black and clearly uncomfortable to wear, the oufits nevertheless spark something deep within your subconscious.  A lost memory, perhaps?  No matter how much you pull at that strand, nothing surfaces.

Flashing brightly, a warning is appended to this outfit: *This is a standardized Slave-Rated Wardrobe outfit, as described in the Aekoran Slave Codes, Chapter 812, subsection 10.  Wearing this uniform will subject all Slaves to High Protocol Laws as described in the Aekoran Slave Code, Chapter 679.  Freewombs wearing this uniform will be subjected to portions of the Slave Code, and certain liberties may be revoked.*

Accessories are listed as the pictured corset, heels, regulation mask, posture collar, and (non-pictured) inserts.  The corset is noted as featuring &#39;real steel&#39; boning, and is custom-measured to match standard Torean expectations of functional corsetry.  So too does the posture collar proudly proclaim its core as being &#39;real steel&#39;, as well as meeting all Aekoran slave law requirements.  The heels are listed as six inches in height, with one inch platforms.  The mask is simply described as rated for Torean storms, as well as regulating oxygen intake.  And the inserts?  Those are described as front and rear installation, custom-molded for maximum stimulation.  All devices feature 10 hour self-release locks.

Makeup is included as well, while the price is listed as requiring an extra 150 credit fee.  You absolutely cannot understand why anyone would pay *more* for such things to be inflicted upon them.  Yet looking back up at those models, perhaps there is something that yearns within, to add a fifth  uniformally adorned and restrained woman to that lineup...

But your confidence holds, allowing you the only seat in the house as the show begins. Further mechanical arms and implements emerge, the largest being a ring wide enough that it barely fit the small room.  It hovers above you, a far too large halo, before the device descends.

Nozzles built into the ring emit a pungent substance as soon as it descends past your neck.  For a moment you think it paint, and it does adhere like the stuff, but the sensation is fleeting-- as following the emitters a white-light laser passes over the freshly applied material, and it flash-cools.  What had been a thick spray is now a thin, slick, glossy material.  Cold upon your skin, but already your body is warming it up.  Torei&#39;s all but sacred material, its most readily available substance: **laminate.**

Thus your metallic blue suit is quiet literally printed on, the ring descending bit by bit, rendering soft flesh into equally soft but so very *different* laminate.  Secondary arms follow it down, providing spot treatment along seams and friction points-- although often the effect is for merely aesthetic purposes.  Sometimes that takes the form of a second application of laminate, other times it lingers to produce something more substantial-- such as the zipper between your legs, the tiny metal components pre-formed and merely placed by the rapid-fire staccato movements of a particuarly agile mechanized arm.

You&#39;re given no time to rest as the base layer concludes, the ring rapidly ascending as other arms move into the space to begin work on your accessories.  Your black gloves are printed, while a longer period is required for the Wardrobe to build up the necessary thickness required of your eight points of restraint.  Those are affixed at ankle, wrist, bicep, waist, and throat.  Again the metal hardpoints are installed last, emerging fully formed from hidden storage components.  A far less expensive option then flash-casting steel.

The final componenent of your outfit comes with the sensation of your own feet rising, the sensation unequal and focused primarily at your heel.  Without the restraint arms you would have toppled over, but they hold you tight, tall heels being extruded into place.  Black laminate follows, coating your feet and providing the anchor on which laces are quickly assembled.

Almost as an afterthought, the promised makeup is applied last.  Mechanical arms seize your head, holding it tight as nozzles approach your face.  A quick blast of air instinctively causes your eyes to close, and in that brief moment the Wardrobe does its work.  Your eyelids have been darkened, the corners twinkling with flecks of metallic blue to match your suit.  Pores and blemishes have been rendered impotent as well, while your cheekbones have been highlighted.  And your lips are now a dark blue, the white of your teeth blinding against them as you gasp slightly.

Then, with a final flash of white light and a conclusive hiss, the armatures withdraw.

Torei&#39;s all but sacred material, its most readily available substance: **laminate.**

Thus your suit is quiet literally printed on, the base layer a solid midnight black.  The ring descends bit by bit, rendering soft flesh into equally soft but so very *different* laminate.  Secondary arms follow it down, providing spot treatment along seams and friction points-- although most of their effort is focused upon the design work of the advertisements and designs now intended to grace your body.  Bold lines run from the white ring around the suit&#39;s collar, down your shoulders.  Other similar designs are placed upon your biceps and near the knee.  The largest are those on your hips (blocky letters spelling out a slaving firm&#39;s name), your chest (which features their vaguely triangular logo), and your back (which encourages others to &#39;submit to advert-wear today!).  A final arm lingers between your legs, working on the zipper located there, the tiny metal components pre-formed and merely placed by the rapid-fire staccato movements of a particuarly agile mechanized arm.

You&#39;re given no time to rest as the base layer concludes, the ring rapidly ascending as other arms move into the space to begin work on the most intensive component of your outfit: the corset.  Several times the arms work along your midsection, printing in thick black material, before pre-forged strips of steel emerge.  Those would be the bones that ensured a corset could trim the waist effectively, and once submerged into the thick material a final flash of light sets the material.  Its not until synthetic lacing is carefully worked in a pattern through the holes along your back that the device actually begins to function, however.  With every tug it grows tighter, never painful, but definitely uncomfortable.  By the time the Wardrobe concludes, your chest is thrust out in response, while your back is straight and breathing takes some effort.

The final componenent of your outfit comes with the sensation of your own feet rising, the sensation unequal and focused entirely at your heel.  Without the restraint arms you would have toppled over, but they hold you tight, towering stilleto heels being extruded into place.  Black laminate follows, coating your feet and providing the anchor on which laces are quickly assembled.  You are now permanently *en pointe*, or as anyone would immediately notice: on your toes.

Almost as an afterthought, the promised makeup is applied last.  Mechanical arms seize your head, holding it tight as nozzles approach your face.  A quick blast of air instinctively causes your eyes to close, and in that brief moment the Wardrobe does its work.  Your eyelids have been darkened and your eyelashes extending, producing an alluring effect.  Pores and blemishes have been rendered impotent as well, while your cheekbones have been highlighted.  And your lips are now a warm red coloration, the triangular logo on your chest repeated in miniature at the center of your bottom lip.

Small pre-forged rivets are sunk into the still molton laminate before it is sealed, as is the belt loop that is seated directly over your naval.  Still held in place, small arms flair the laminate that extends over your rear, achieving the look most of the galaxy would label as *slutty* but Torei saw as merely coquettish.

The final componenent of your outfit comes with the sensation of your own feet rising, the sensation unequal and focused primarily at your heel.  Without the restraint arms you would have toppled over, but they hold you tight, tall heels being extruded into place.  More red laminate follows, coating your feet excepting the stylish hole at the very front.

Almost as an afterthought, the promised makeup is applied last.  Mechanical arms seize your head, holding it tight as nozzles approach your face.  A quick blast of air instinctively causes your eyes to close, and in that brief moment the Wardrobe does its work.  Your eyelids have been darkened, a crimson secondary coat added that flashed only when light slid across it.  Pores and blemishes have been rendered impotent as well, while your cheekbones have been highlighted.  And your lips are now a poignant, inviting red.

Then, with a final flash of white light and a conclusive hiss, the armatures withdraw.

[[&quot;Wow.&quot;-&gt;Sec III]]
[[&quot;At least its... vaguely office-ready?&quot;-&gt;Sec III]]
[[That was **terrifying!**&quot;-&gt;Sec III]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="71" name="Resist Slave" tags="Debt" position="1234,4163" size="100,100">You pull against the restraining arms, eyes wide as other devices emerge from the walls.  Compared to your earlier experience on your own bed, these at least have some give-- your first yank of the arm nearly sends you tumbling over, but the arm momentarily loses grip on you entirely.

This *can* be escaped!

If not for the arm behind you, waiting silently.  You do not see it, but you certainly *feel* the sudden snap of electricty that bursts upon your rear, pain receptors announcing the experience with a unified yelp that matches the sound that emerges from your own lips.

*REMAIN STILL.*

The display had returned to life to deliver the command, the cold steel of what you can only imagine to be a cattle prod still poised against her buttocks.  You take a deep breath... and settle back as the arm restraint returns.

*Minor damage has been recorded to Arm 5-L-6. A 20 credit charge has been made to your account.*
(set: $debt to it + 20) (set: $debtResist to true)
[[Well, that didn&#39;t work.-&gt;Slave Confirm2]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="72" name="Slave Confirm2" tags="" position="1384,4161" size="100,100">The urge is there to close your eyes, as if ignorance could prevent what was about to occur.  Why *had* you chosen the most expensive, most intensive option?  But your confidence holds, allowing you the only seat in the house as the show begins. Further mechanical arms and implements emerge, the largest being a ring wide enough that it barely fit the small room.  It hovers above you, a far too large halo, waiting only for an attendant arm to strategically place your blonde hair before the device descends.

Nozzles built into the ring emit a pungent substance as soon as it descends past the crown of your head.  For a moment you think it paint, and it does adhere like the stuff, but the sensation is fleeting-- as following the emitters a white-light laser passes over the freshly applied material, and it flash-cools.  What had been a thick spray is now a thin, slick, glossy material.  Holes at your mouth, nose, and eyes are quickly excised.  Cold upon your skin, but already your body is warming it up.  Torei&#39;s all but sacred material, its most readily available substance: **laminate.**

Thus your suit is quiet literally printed on, the base layer a solid midnight black.  The ring descends bit by bit, rendering soft flesh into equally soft but so very *different* laminate.  Secondary arms follow it down, providing spot treatment along seams and friction points-- although often the effect is for merely aesthetic purposes.  Sometimes that takes the form of a second application of laminate, other times it lingers to produce something more substantial-- such as the zipper between your legs, the tiny metal components pre-formed and merely placed by the rapid-fire staccato movements of a particuarly agile mechanized arm.

You&#39;re given no time to rest as the base layer concludes, the ring rapidly ascending as other arms move into the space to begin work on the most intensive component of your outfit: the corset.  Several times the arms work along your midsection, printing in thick black material, before pre-forged strips of steel emerge.  Those would be the bones that ensured a corset could trim the waist effectively, and once submerged into the thick material a final flash of light sets the material.  Its not until synthetic lacing is carefully worked in a pattern through the holes along your back that the device actually begins to function, however.  With every tug it grows tighter, never painful, but definitely uncomfortable.  By the time the Wardrobe concludes, your chest is thrust out in response, while your back is straight and breathing takes some effort.

Given the intended production of a full scale regulation mask, the promised makeup is applied next.  Mechanical arms seize your head, holding it tight as nozzles approach your face.  A quick blast of air instinctively causes your eyes to close, and in that brief moment the Wardrobe does its work.  Your eyelids have been darkened and your eyelashes extended, producing an alluring effect.  And your lips are now a bright red coloration, an interesting detail given what comes next.

That would be your mask, listed for *breath regulation*.  You already have been provided with a thin hood much akin to the rest of your catsuit, but this secondary mask is much thicker, several armatures working together to forge it upon your face.  A handful of metal components are integrated as well, but your field of vision had already been restricted enough that you barely notice.  Indeed, before you know it a curved glass panel is being placed just before your eyes, the laminate seals along the edge flash-cooling.

Your next breath, the first within your new enclosed environment, is thus harder.  *Much* harder.  You gasp, trying to suck in enough oxygen-- only for your corset&#39;s constriction to assert itself.  It&#39;s a devious combination, one you would have almost certainly cursed had not the machine (and thus your own focus) already shifted elsewhere.

Several attending arms move back up to your throat, casting thick laminate in yet another layer until several steel segments (much like those trimming your waist) are sunk into the material.  The Wardrobe was ensuring your head remained up, but you&#39;re hit with the immediate sensation that was no longer necessary-- the collar would ensure your posture going forward.

Yet another componenent of your outfit comes with the sensation of your own feet rising, the sensation unequal and primarily at your heel.  Without the restraint arms you would have toppled over, but they hold you tight, tall stilleto heels and a thick platform for your toes being extruded into place.  Black laminate follows, coating your feet and providing the anchor on which laces are quickly assembled.

[[Is... is it over?-&gt;Slave Confirm3]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="73" name="Blue III" tags="" position="404,4304" size="100,100">You take a deep breath, watching the shiny blue material covering your chest gently rise and fall.  The sensation is almost otherwordly, light pressure upon your body from to toe to throat, a lover&#39;s embrace you cannot escape.  Excepting the zipper between your legs, there is no point of entrance, no direct break in the experience.  Only smooth laminate, and the sweet scent of lingering rubber.

Running a hand down the slick material reveals laminate to laminate contact to be almost frictionless.  It&#39;s almost too easy to forget your own hand as it glides along your hip.  The gentle *click* of the metal studded into your cuffs provide a more consistent narrative, as does the more authoritative snap of your heeled boot as you shift a bit in the Wardrobe&#39;s small confines.

A sudden light breaks your self examination as the Wardrobe&#39;s display flicks back into existence, a final sentence emerging upon it.

They plunge further, and further-- your mind screams for an end, your body assures you it cannot take anymore.  Yet it does.  Still further, further, further...

Until you&#39;re hilted on the ends, hips swaying minutely as you try fruitlessly to adapt to the sensation.  It may be amusing in restrospect, if you ever allow yourself to remember this moment, how gentle the final arm is that pulls your zipper closed again.

As they work, another more nimble arm presses forward, seizing upon the only zipper on your suit.

The answer?  Your body knows what it wants.  It ignores your currently quite public position in the middle of a hallway as your legs give out, falling to your knees upon the floor.  Your more sensible hand moves to your mask, trying weakly to push it off, to free yourself from the strict breath regulation.  Your other, however, traces tantalizingly along the base of your front insert.  Hidden by the locked zipper, but accessible by mere touch nevertheless.

You moan quietly, eyes closing as you lean back onto your haunches...

Nimble gloved fingers press into the laminate between your legs, shifting the cock buried there as a hiss of pleasure works through your mask regulators.  You can barely breath, but that&#39;s hardly necessary, not as waves of pleasure begin to roll up against your womanhood.  Overzealous motivations at first drive you into quite a bit of fumbling, but it doesn&#39;t take long for you to settle into a steady rhythm, pressing your thumb hard against the front plug as you lean further, driving the rear one into the back of your heel.  Somewhere along the way the hand at your mask travels downward, finding a far more *useful* purpose at your own breast, playing with the hardened bud as you wantonly pleasure yourself.

The waves of ecstasy rise, eventually overtoppign you in a final tsunami of sensation.  Do you even truly experience it?  Already an amnesiac, you&#39;re not sure on this one-- all you recall is the sweet pulses from your cunt dissolving into static, everything going blank...

Until you rouse, a pile of black laminate gasping on the hotel hallway floor.  It takes you several long moments before you can pull yourself back to your knees, and from there your feet.  Your plugged cunt&#39;s aching desire had momentarily fled, but you are treated to the sensation of your own bodily juices shifting within.

&quot;I... see.  This establishment is fitted with industry standard automated observation protocols, for guest protection of course.  And I am seeing several such charges on your account resulting from that program.  I hope you understand that I cannot advise leaving the premises with an active balance?  That would require I contact the Ministry of Truants on your behalf, and you *are* a freewomb.&quot;

The way she says it, that doesn&#39;t sound good.  Yet her smile returns.

&quot;Given our frequent offworlder guests, however, we do feature a robust debt relief program.  Would you like to explore those options?  Or I would be happy to answer any other questions you may have at this time, as long as you remain within this building.&quot;

[[&quot;What exactly do you mean by &#39;debt relief&#39;?&quot;-&gt;FrontQQ]]

If anyone knows about what happened to you, it seems likely it would be this woman.  She certainly *seems* familiar with you.

You do, which she reads back, making sure her data entry was correct.  It is.

But sliding back over to her computer, she quickly makes an effort to improve upon that answer.  &quot;Can you give me that address one more time?
(set: $AskAddress to true)
It takes only a few moments for her to pull up the relevent information.  &quot;Ah!  Here it is.  Seems to be a... nightclub, of some sort?  Deep in downtown Grand Aekora, though.  We&#39;re located in the outskirts right now, if you can&#39;t remember that.  Couple ways to get there.  Train, carriage, and always the Lead.&quot;

[[Good to know, I suppose.  Can I ask something else?-&gt;Front Q]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="91" name="Min Q" tags="" position="242,5462" size="100,100">The girl nods enthusiastically.  &quot;Yeah, Torei has a bunch of Ministries.  Not every Ringdom has them all, but Aekora does have most-- and that means the Ministry of Truants.  Think of them like our police, but as I understand it, you offworlders don&#39;t have many laws for women, right?&quot;

She seems to be waiting for a response, but you&#39;re not sure you even have one.  Laws for women?

Eventually she just continues.  &quot;Well we do, ma&#39;am.  There are a *lot*.  Way too many for me to go over.  Usually I just advise freewomb guests like yourself to always keep your identification permit with you, and to be careful traveling after dark.  They&#39;re very strict about curfew, and really, its best to just try and avoid the Officers altogether.&quot;

Again she gestures towards your oufit.  &quot;(if: $Blue is true)[If you don&#39;t avoid them, that&#39;s why you&#39;ve got cuffs on that suit.] (if: $Smoke is true)[If you don&#39;t avoid them, those thigh cuffs won&#39;t be the only ones you&#39;re stuck wearing.] (if: $Brand is true)[I wouldn&#39;t suggest running from them in regular circumstances, but with your heels?  Just keep your eyes down, ma&#39;am.] (if: $Sec is true)[That outfit you chose might be the best for blending in, actually.  Torean, but clearly with some agency.  Truant Officers might ignore you.] (if: $Slave is true)[Wearing that, you *will* be stopped by them.  Slave laws are much more strict, and while you are a freewomb they won&#39;t know that until they check your card.]&quot;

That is an important one to know, here on Torei.  Technically there are two classes of women here on Torei, but I really think of them as being three.  There are freewombs like yourself,&quot; she reaches up, tapping her collar.  &quot;And there are slaves, like myself.  In between, that third class, are indentured servants.  Usually technically freewombs, but serving contracts or working off debt.  There are lots of ways to fall into debt on Torei, especially for offworlders who aren&#39;t careful.  So watch out for that.&quot;

Her eyes grow distant for a moment, her smile widening.  &quot;Many Toreans would argue a slave&#39;s collar is the easier life, here.&quot;

(if: $Blue is true or $Slave is true)[[[&quot;I&#39;m a Freewomb... but I do have a collar?&quot;-&gt;Collar Q]]]

She shifts her attention to her computer, pulling up a few files before continuing.  &quot;You checked in alone about a week ago, prepaid up to today.  If it helps, I&#39;m here on duty more often then not.  Saw you come and go a few times, but you never returned with anyone that I noticed.  Most folk at least *try* a bit of the Torean experience when staying here too, but you didn&#39;t.  Wouldn&#39;t think you the sort to go for Mem-Burn.  Not until now.&quot;

It isn&#39;t much, but your sense of self is at least a *bit* clearer.  This may be a good time to ask any questions that come to mind, and there is the matter of your debt to address as well.

The purple is so much brighter then your own black.  &quot;That&#39;s different.  You eventually will be allowed out of that collar and suit... if you desire that.

&quot;You current amounted owed is: (print: $debt) credits.&quot;

Raising a hand, she begins listing how you got there, raising a finger each time:
(if: $debtRing is true)[&quot;An automated scan of your room revealed a broken d-ring on your bed.  That wood is imported, so we must add a 35 credit charge.&quot;]
(if: $debtHelp is true)[&quot;I&#39;m certain you recall the pair of charges you accepted when I freed you from your self bondage?  That was 50 credits total.&quot;]
(if: $debtChangeEscape is true)[&quot;Your service button was triggered, but you did not answer.  Perhaps you should have, the time you took to get here afterward made you late to checkout.  That is a 50 credit charge.&quot;]
(if: $debtShower is true)[&quot;The sonic shower in your room registered a lengthy use today.  Presuming that was you, it made you late to checkout.  That is a 50 credit charge.&quot;]
(if: $debtTV is true)[&quot;The television within your room communicated a good bit of time turned on today. Unfortunately that extra time came after checkout period ended, and thus earned you a 20 credit fine.&quot;]
(if: $debtFrontNude is true)[&quot;You walked nude into this front desk area, a designated public area by Aekoran decency laws.  That was a 30 credit fine.&quot;]
(if: $debtBrand is true)[&quot;Your choice of submission to an Advert-Wear catsuit earned you 50 credits, good choice.  Sorry again about those boots.&quot;]
(if: $debtSec is true)[&quot;Your selection of the Sextretarial Delight outfit from our Wardrobe device incurred a 50 credit charge.&quot;]
(if: $debtSlave is true)[&quot;Your selection of a fully Slave-Rated Enclosure suit incurred a significant 150 credit fee.&quot;  Meanwhile you try not to shift your hips, and thus your plugs too much.]
(if: $debtResist is true)[&quot;Minor damage was reported from our Wardrobe Device during your recent dressing. That is a 20 credit fine.&quot;]
(if: $debtResist2 is true)[&quot;The Wardrobe Device communicated use of its subjugation prod during your installation into that Slave-Rated suit.  Aekoran law requires a 20 credit fine in such an instance.&quot;]
(if: $debtCard is true)[&quot;And... finally, there was the 20 credit fine for your keycard replacement, as we discussed earlier.&quot;]

Reaching up to run a hand through her hair requires her to shift her other arm as well, the chain between her wrists an impediment she barely seems to notice.  &quot;So-- (print: $debt) credits.  That&#39;s (if: $debt is &lt;= 50)[not too bad, actually.&quot;](if: $debt is &gt; 50 and &lt;= 100)[starting to get up there, ma&#39;am.&quot;](if: $debt is &gt; 100 and &lt;= 200)[rather high, I&#39;m afraid.&quot;](if: $debt is &gt; 200)[a very serious outstanding balance.&quot;]

It&#39;s almost unnecessary, given the chain also linking her wrists.

&quot;Yes ma&#39;am. Since I sold myself once I hit majority.  It can be hard for offworlders to understand, but it is all I looked forward to.  There is security in a collar you can&#39;t get elsewhere on Torei, as a woman.&quot;

She leans across the table, once again eyeing your full enclosure suit.  &quot;But I came to *like* it, too.  Losing control... it&#39;s something else...&quot;

Her smile is wide.  &quot;Isn&#39;t it.?&quot;

You take a deep breath, trying hard to ignore your plugs.

&quot;Believe me, ma&#39;am-- this is much better then getting a Truant Officer involved.&quot;

Wrists, ankles, and throat are seized, although the presence of your clothing does make it a somewhat gentler experience this time around.

Moving downward in a wave, the Wardrobe begins working on your promised hobble chain.  Instead of working solely in direct steel, it instead uses only a few strategically placed filiments to reinforce the hard-sealed laminate it uses otherwise.  (if: $Blue is true)[The presence of your ankle cuffs are integrated into the design, the metal loops there being used to anchor the chain itself that is finished with a chromed, silvery finish.] (if: $Smoke is true)[Lacking ankle cuffs, fresh ones are first printed for you, the black laminate matching those you already wore at your thighs. The chain between them is finished with a chromed, silvery look sure to catch the light as readily as your see-through catsuit.] (if: $Brand is true)[Lacking ankle cuffs, fresh ones are first printed for you, the red laminate used matching the design of the logos elsewhere on your body. The chain between them is finished with a white coloration, again coordinating with your adverts.] (if: $Sec is true)[Lacking ankle cuffs, fresh ones are first printed for you, the red laminate worked with slightly flared metal designs for the metal components, coordinating with the rest of your professional attire. The chain between them is finished with a chromed, silvery look sure to catch the light.] (if: $Slave is true)[Lacking ankle cuffs, fresh ones are first printed for you, in thick black laminate with heavy steel components to which the chain connects.  Undoubtedly following slave-ratings, the chain itself is quite heavy, and rendered fully in black.]

You emerge from the Wardrobe Device for a second time, once again transformed...

...and this time, not alone.  Another guest of the hotel had apparently just exited her room, a woman perhaps near your age (although Torei&#39;s medical technologies made it so difficult to tell.)  Her outfit is immaculate, all black laminate with poofed shoulders and tall thigh-high stilletos.  She wears the material, including  smartly fastened corset, with an ease you cannot imagine.  

Reflective, mirror-like glasses hide her gaze, but you cannot help but imagine her staring.  Ruby red lips curl into a smile as she pauses, closing her room&#39;s door but otherwise lingering.  After a long moment she gestures for you to pass, the gloved movement as smooth and cool as her half-veiled expression.

[[Just pass her... calmly-&gt;Hallway Pass]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="112" name="Debt End IV" tags="" position="845,6266" size="100,100">No opportunity for rest is given as the Wardrobe whirls, arms cycling upward as those gripped to your wrists suddenly jerk your arms back.  It isn&#39;t a gentle experience.  Given the larger print job, three of the device&#39;s appendages begin circling your arms, coating them in the laminate that is quickly flash-set into a tight layer.  Reinforcements are built into the area around your hands to prevent an escape, and so that a large ring can be emplaced-- which, once cooled an armature seizes, demonstrating just how easily you can now be controlled that way.  The final component is the portion that circles around your shoulders and upper chest, anchoring the binder and preventing it from being slipped off easily.

Already your shoulders whine with hints of pain, the position unpracticed.

Perhaps you had not intended to rack up a debt as high as it had gotten.  How could you truly have known?  But Torei does not ask for apologies.  It demanded correction, this time of a more pemanent nature then mere bindings-- just as promised.

The device holding onto your armbinder&#39;s ring pulls suddenly downward just as your legs are yanked forward.  You&#39;re suspended in the air now, back arched, breasts pressing against the laminate cups of your oufit as they&#39;re thrust out.  (if: $lave is true or $Brand is true)[Your corset makes the position painful in the extreme.]

It&#39;s then that a new armature appears, this one new, at least to your eyes.  Instead of a gripping limb, or a painter-like nozzle, this has something much more sinister: a lancing needle.  Long, silvery... and move mechanically down, towards your breasts.  The protection offered by your outfit is momentarily vacated, solvants being applied that melt the material readily in a steam that fans suck away greedily.  With unnerving precision, the needle is positioned.  There is no fanfare, no warning-- it merely shifts suddenly, one moment waiting beside your nipple, the next pierced straight through it.  

[[You scream.-&gt;Debt End VI]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="114" name="Debt End VI" tags="" position="845,6567" size="100,100">The Wardrobe device doesn&#39;t much care for your reaction.  It does provide a quite fast acting healing agent, undoubtedly a Torean marvel of bioengineering that would have fascinated the Prospector that is your job title, but that seems less a kindness and more simple utilitarianism.  Once healed, a silvery barbell is inserted, your violation now marked by the small silver balls now framing the highlight of your chest.

You hang limply as the procedure is repeated on your other nipple.  Afterward the nozzles return, reapplying the laminate of your suit.  Its as if they had never torn it apart, but the foreign sensations emanating from your chest are a constant reminder...

Your hobble chain loudly snaps with your first step as it pulls tight, the restricted gait unnatural.  You can manage something more then a shuffle, but its hardly dignified.  (if: $Level is 2 or 3 or 4)[For the first time you realize just how helpless the armbinder has rendered you as well, (if: $Blue or $Slave is true)[the device conspiring with your corset to thrust out your chest and rear.](else:)[the effect of the device on your arms thrusting out your chest and rear.]  Were the woman&#39;s midnight clad hands to grab you, its clear you could offer little resistance.]  Yet she doesn&#39;t move, merely observing as you make your way past.

No owner is marked upon the thick posture collar, she could certainly see that.]

Once past, you try to put her out of your thoughts,  focusing once more on the passage from hallway to front office.  There the servant waits, expectantly.

The sound of heeled shoes on the tiled floor draws your attention back towards the hallway, however, where the woman glimpsed earlier emerges.  One hand grips the small purse slung over her shoulder, while the other crosses beneath her chest, supporting a pensive posture as she boldly passes through the Front Office and out the front door.

The servant had paused to watch as well, but her attention returns to you as soon as the front door closes again.  &quot;We were talking about... your departure, correct?&quot;

Her own top, violet see-through laminate, does feature the steel adornments to her nipples quite prominently.  She certainly had to be an expert on the matter, but her enthusiasm for... Torean culture perhaps far exceeded your own.

&quot;Oh, don&#39;t be like that,&quot; the employee tsk-tsks.  &quot;You&#39;ve come so far, and you&#39;ve *earned this.*  Besides, you&#39;re technically under slave codes until your debt is cleared.  Any resistance, and I will append additional fees.  That means more applications of the crop, and you already have (print: $debt / 5) to undergo.  Alright?&quot;

She doesn&#39;t wait for a response, but instead rises, leaving her desk.  Its only then that you notice the chain descending from the ceiling, in the corner of the office.  Of course she makes for, waiting for you to join her before grabbing the ring on your armbinder tightly.  You nearly lose your balance as she lifts the ring, forcing your arms up, and your head down.  It appears to be a maneuver she&#39;s quite well versed in, as she quickly has the ring snapped to the chain.

You&#39;re now bent over, arms back and pulled up.  The heels on your boots ensure your rear is neatly displayed, pert rear and rounded thighs gleaming in the light.  

&quot;I am going to apply the crop,&quot; she explains.  &quot;Once for every 5 credits you still owe, as we discussed.  It will be your job to count the strikes, aloud.  I would hate to give you too many... or too few. Understood?&quot;

Despite everything you had gone through since leaving your room, the mystery of your waking still stood to be answered.  Had your memory been forcibly wiped, or had you subjected yourself to such an experience?  What could drive you to do such a thing?

Your evidence is as scant as the resources you have available: three measely cards.  The elevator ticket for the Way Up expired tomorrow night, but it promised your one clear chance to free you of Torei forever-- an escape from the humiliation, the bondage, the laminate you had found yourself so readily falling into.

But that would mean abandoning the enigma that was the black card and its promise of a potential deal, your original reason for coming to the planet in the first place.  The wealth that would result from a successful prospecting mission to this planet would remain untapped.  

You could try for both, the black card&#39;s rendezvous is planned for tonight, giving you perhaps a day to make your way to the elevator.  But as your third and final card, the one the served as your ID, reminded with the bold red letters stamped across the top... here you were a FREEWOMB first, and there could be so many pitfalls waiting on Torei&#39;s streets.

(if: $Strike is 4)[You moan slightly as the crop slaps home again, the competing sounds perfectly timed to catch the sudden appearance of a third figure in the room-- the woman you passed in the hallway.  Once again, a bemused smile finds her bright lips as she strides confidently over, silencing the attending slave with one upheld finger.  She doesn&#39;t demand much, only the opportunity to slide her laminate fingers up between your legs, rubbing briefly at the zipper covering your cunt.  Your knees shake of their own accord in response, a second-- more hungry-- moan escaping.  And then she is gone, crossing the rest of the room to exit out the front door as the servant beside you demands a fresh strike count.  Even then the sensation of the woman&#39;s touch lingers...(set: $Fondled to true)]

(if: $Strike is 6)[The slave varies her placement every few hits, sometimes high on your rear, sometimes further down near the tops of your thighs.  Wherever she hits, it hurts.]

(if: $Strike is 11)[Tears form in the corners of your eyes as the strikes persist, your body tensing up as soon as you give the count, now.]

(if: $Strike is 13)[The servant attending you pauses, tapping the crop lightly between your legs, along the interior of a thigh.  &quot;Ass up,&quot; she commands.  &quot;You must stand ready to receive, not hang in your bondage.&quot;

Freewombs such as yourself commonly do.&quot;

She tips her head back and forth, bangs swaying pendulum like.  &quot;Honestly I didn&#39;t expect a woman such as yourself to wear some, but given your financial situation... you did notice the locks on them, right?  They will come off in a few hours.  Aekoran law requires that for any freebies at a Wardrobe.  Ministry of Truants asserts it makes dealing with loiters and vagabonds easier.  They&#39;re usually the only sort to wear the free stuff.&quot;

Timed locks are included, so you don&#39;t go back on your advertising contract.  They&#39;re on your corset too, if you haven&#39;t noticed.  Not sure why they went with ballets, though.  Usually its offworlders who go for the advert-suits.  And ballets aren&#39;t friendly to those sorts at all.  Ooo! Maybe that&#39;s part of the advertisement!  You know, seeing an offworlder struggling in ballets, branded with a big slaver&#39;s ad?  Makes the better investment clear!&quot;  

She shrugs and you shift from one foot to the other, trying to remain *en pointe* before her.  &quot;Toreans don&#39;t go for it because we know it&#39;s much more lucrative to sell *yourself* instead of just your clothes for a few hours, ma&#39;am.  That tip is free.&quot;

It takes her only a second or two for a conclusion to be reached.

&quot;Sorry, ma&#39;am.  Afraid not.  I guess the latest update removed the regulation valve on the side.  You&#39;re in there until the timed locks give out, that&#39;s always been standard.  But looks like the recent law revisions decided to make it harder on you.&quot;

You step back, heels clicking upon the marble floor as she continues.  It&#39;s hard to suppress the moan that comes from your shifting inserts.  &quot;Only thing I can tell you is that design is by far the most common, here in Aekora.

&quot;Yes,&quot; she finally murmurs.  &quot;We&#39;re done.&quot;

Reaching up, she unhooks your armbinder ring from the ceiling chain, allowing you to straighten back up.  Even the barest movement brings echoes of the punishment back towards your nerve endings.  Its even worse as you follow her back over to the front desk, which she takes a seat at.  

Perhaps you&#39;ve learned a lesson?

She doesn&#39;t provide a reason why you would, but instead circles the front desk to walk you to the front door.

&quot;There are also carriages, and the train line of course.  Those take credits...&quot; she looks to your restraints, and winks.  &quot;But let&#39;s not get into that again.  You&#39;re a resourceful girl, I&#39;m certain you can figure it out!&quot;

The street is plain concrete, the foliage growing in the spaces of green perhaps a bit stunted, but look regular enough.  Even the buildings are not too bizarre.  You appear to be in a relatively built up city, but looking North reveals much larger towers reaching towards the sky.  That had to be downtown Grand Aekora-- and thus the direction you would need to travel, in pursuit of the promised transport center.  

But there is the matter of the *people* who share the street with you.  The wide road is bizarrely empty, but the sidewalks abound with life.  Nearly all are women, a factoid breaking through your amnesia to remind you that among the Torean-born, women greatly outnumbered men.  And some of them are looking your way.

You do not have the choice to hide, indeed your laminate only seems to announce you *wanted* the attention.  Everything is on display.

At least you&#39;re not alone in the experience.  Laminate clothing appears universal, everyone you pass exclusively wearing the material-- although what you infer from each outfit varies greatly.  The presence of a collar provides a rough dividing line between those who keep their eyes down, and those who stride forward confidently.  Catsuits and stilleto heels are in abundance, and even a few like yourself are visibly bound.

The Wardrobe whirls, arms cycling upward as those gripped to your wrists suddenly jerk your arms back.  It isn&#39;t a gentle experience.  Given the larger print job, three of the device&#39;s appendages begin circling your arms, coating them in the laminate that is quickly flash-set into a tight layer.  Reinforcements are built into the area around your hands to prevent an escape, and so that a large ring can be emplaced-- which, once cooled an armature seizes, demonstrating just how easily you can now be controlled that way.  The final component is the portion that circles around your shoulders and upper chest, anchoring the binder and preventing it from being slipped off easily.

You emerge to find Isabella waiting, her glasses resting on her forehead so that she can given the Wardrobe&#39;s work a discerning look over.  She tugs on the laminate covering your shoulders, and the outline of your elbows.  Whatever she finds apparently meets her standards as she reaches up, dropping her glasses back into place.

Stepping forward she reaches out, one hand finding your (if: $Brand is true or $Slave is true)[tightly corseted] waist, corralling you as her other hand explores one of your shiny(if: $Blue is true)[blue] (if: $Smoke is true)[smoky] (if: $Brand is true)[logo adorned] (if: $Sec is true)[white] (if: $Slave is true)[black] breasts.

Changing outfits after or just prior to a trip seems to be common.

Isabella selects an open Wardrobe for you, using her own credentials to bring up a far more extensive catalog of options then you had seen at the Hotel.  Selecting silvered piercings described as *Torean Standard*, she indicates the now opened door.

The customary arms grab at your wrists, ankles, and throat-- but another also seizes the ring set in your armbinder.  You&#39;re left imagining what for, or at least until it demonstrates.

The device holding onto your armbinder&#39;s ring pulls suddenly downward just as your legs are yanked forward.  You&#39;re suspended in the air now, back arched, breasts pressing against the laminate cups of your oufit as they&#39;re thrust out.  (if: $lave is true or $Brand is true)[Your corset makes the position painful in the extreme.]

It&#39;s then that a new armature appears, this one new, at least to your eyes.  Instead of a gripping limb, or a painter-like nozzle, this has something much more sinister: a lancing needle.  Long, silvery... and move mechanically down, towards your breasts.  The protection offered by your outfit is momentarily vacated, solvants being applied that melt the material readily in a steam that fans suck away greedily.  With unnerving precision, the needle is positioned.  There is no fanfare, no warning-- it merely shifts suddenly, one moment waiting beside your nipple, the next pierced straight through it.  

The Wardrobe device doesn&#39;t much care for your reaction.  It does provide a quite fast acting healing agent, undoubtedly a Torean marvel of bioengineering that would have fascinated the Prospector that is your job title, but that seems less a kindness and more simple utilitarianism.  Once healed, a silvery barbell is inserted, your violation now marked by the small silver balls now framing the highlight of your chest.

You hang limply as the procedure is repeated on your other nipple.  Afterward the nozzles return, reapplying the laminate of your suit.  Its as if they had never torn it apart, but the foreign sensations emanating from your chest are a constant reminder...

It is the color of power, of dominance-- and conversely, abject submission.  But something like this, your bright blue?

(if: $Blue is true)[&quot;I like the color,&quot; she notes, fondling your chest gently.  &quot;Black has such a peculiar meaning, on Torei.  It is the color of power, of dominance-- and conversely, abject submission.  But something like this, your bright blue?  Those with a submissive mindset should enjoy the bright colors allowed to them.  I prefer it in my slaves.  It allows you to acquire the attention of your betters, it places your entire body on display.  That&#39;s how you can become valuable.&quot;

Her attention shifts to the black of your various cuffs, a finger sliding along your belt.  &quot;And you chose something so readily intended for bondage.  Do you *like* being restrained?  I bet you do.&quot;] (if: $Smoke is true)[&quot;You must have been quite horny when picking that oufit,&quot; she notes, fondling your chest gently.  &quot;Transparency is a fashion statement unto itself, but it so often trends towards the submissive-- and its almost always too adventurous for offworlders.

You are well endowed even without the Ministry of Improvements working on you, that should be emphasized.] (if: $Brand is true)[&quot;So, are you merely frugal, or is there something more in this choice of outfit,&quot; she asks, a hand moving up to gently fondle your breasts.  &quot;Perhaps you&#39;re an exhibitionist.  Deep down, you want the attention being branded so garishly like this gives you.  Someone else&#39;s words written on your thighs, an invitation for others to join you in submission on your back?  It&#39;s not something we see often on Torei-- those who wish to be slaves can get the full experience so easily, after all.&quot;

Her attention shifts to your boots.  &quot;Those look fun, though.  I bet your ankles are killing you already.  Toes too.&quot;] (if: $Sec is true)[&quot;I like this look on you,&quot; she explains, a hand casually playing with your breast.  You&#39;re trying to maintain something like your dignity, despite everything.  A professional look can go far in pursuit of that.&quot;

Her hand slips between your knees, momentarily playing along your inner thighs.  &quot;But everyone knows you working girls don&#39;t wear panties so you can use your cunts at the first opportunity.  Working hard certainly helps, but its always the slut on her knees that gets the promotion-- isn&#39;t it?&quot;] (if: $Slave is true)[&quot;Look at you,&quot; she muses, casually playing with one of your encapsulted breasts.  &quot;Already just another black laminate slave, one of... thousands, perhaps millions.  Did you know how hard it would be to get out of that suit, when you first submitted to it?  Slaves like you are treated like almost interchangeable property, even if you hold Freewomb status... because that&#39;s what you are.  Two plugged holes, constantly primed for your betters... a breath regulating mask to take away your identity, to keep you compliant... and a thick corset to show off that pretty ass.  And I bet you just *love* the idea of it.&quot;]

She responds with an immediate frown, those red lips looking so fierce as her brows pull down.

Now above you Isabella shifts her own posture, spreading her legs.

She takes a deep breath, sitting back up.  Below, she pulls her zipper back into place.  &quot;Maybe next time.&quot;

&quot;The art of the Reverence, Curfew, the Ministry of Improvements, men on Torei, and... slavery.&quot;  The Torean woman smiles.  

&quot;Which would you like to cover?&quot;

[[&quot;Reverence, I suppose.&quot;-&gt;PlayRev]]
[[&quot;Let&#39;s talk about Curfew.&quot;-&gt;PlayCurfew]]
[[&quot;The... Ministry of Improvements?&quot;-&gt;PlayImprov]]
[[&quot;Let&#39;s talk about... men.&quot;-&gt;PlayMen]]
[[&quot;Slavery?&quot;-&gt;PlayOutfit]]
[[&quot;Actually, I&#39;ve learned enough.  I think I&#39;m ready for the test.&quot;-&gt;PlayETest]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="184" name="PlayRev" tags="" position="1288,9025" size="100,100">&quot;Ah yes,&quot; the woman before you nods.  &quot;Reverence is an ancient Torean custom.  Were I in control of the Way Up, I would demand instructions on it be given to every arriving offworlder.  Any Torean worth being collared by will demand you practice it, after all.  So what exactly is a reverence?&quot;

She pauses to draw another inhalation of her sweetly scented electronic cigarette.  &quot;Some call it the Torean curtsy.  In short: as a woman, slave or freewomb, it is expected during any greeting or parting through which you are interacting with a superior in social rank.  How you approach it is largely dependent on your clothing, however.  And your bondage.  The *classic* reverence is done if you are wearing a skirt, whereupon you spread your legs-- watching the distance carefully, too far and it is considered wanton, whoreish-- and lift your skirt to present your womanhood to the other person.  It does not matter if you are thus bared, or wearing panties, or even chastity.  The purpose is merely to present your current situation.  During this, you lower your eyes, and depending on the social status of the person opposite you bow.  Just a hint for a peer, further for someone of authority-- further still in formal situations, or if you are in the presence of any free male.&quot;

Isbella gestures towards your oufit.  &quot;In your case? (if: $Sec is true)[If your arms are free, you would perform the classic reverence.  That particular outfit is, in fact, designed with just such a use in mind.  You would pull the hem of your skirt up, reveal yourself, then bow as far as circumstances demand.](else:)[Wearing a catsuit, as we both are, is a common enough thing as well.  In our cases, if your arms are free, we would bow as usual, but in a singular smooth motion as we undo our crotch zipper-- then zip it closed again.  The trick is to do it all quickly enough to appear well practiced, but not so quickly as to appear hurried.  And if bound(if: $Level is &gt; 1)[ as you are]?  Then, in casual encounters you would spread your legs and press your hips forward, present your zipper as best you can.  In formal circumstances you would kneel, legs spread.]&quot;

[[&quot;Reverence... got it.&quot;-&gt;IsPlayE Hub]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="185" name="PlayCurfew" tags="" position="680,9120" size="100,100">Like a reigning schoolmistress, Isabella tips her head in a sage-like fashion.  &quot;Of course.  Each Ringdom is different, and a handful do not hold such rules... but most do, including this one.  Curfew applies to all women of majority, and effectively demands we not travel outdoors after dark unescorted.&quot;

She sighs.  &quot;It is one of the more troublesome laws, truth be told.  A legal escort must be male, and even with you offworlders coming in there are still precious few men.  You must be leashed as well, and obviously there is a very real power dynamic involved there.  Alternatives are a freewomb curfew exemption, a thing *very* rarely given, using point-to-point transport such as a carriage... or the Lead.  Generally I utilize a carriage, but if say I were to attend a fancy gala a male escort would be expected.  High society thrives on discussions of which man you have acquired for such things... or been forced to submit to.&quot;

[[&quot;I believe I understand.&quot;-&gt;IsPlayE Hub]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="186" name="PlayMen" tags="" position="795,9088" size="100,100">&quot;You want to discuss *men*,&quot; Isabella replies, taking an amused tone.  &quot;All women do, eventually.&quot;

She settles into her lesson with a slight shift of her seated position to become more comfortable.  &quot;You may or may not remember, given your situation, that men on Torei are rare-- generally one existing for every ten women.  This gives them power, and the laws of most Ringdoms only further that.  As long as they are not slaves, and few are, they are not subjected to curfew.  They are excluded from most Ministry of Truancy spot checks and detainment.  And earning credits is hardly difficult for them, a night providing legal escort is often enough for someone to live comfortably for a week.&quot;

Her legs shift, uncrossing, then crossing again.  &quot;When interacting with a man, understand that you are subservient to him even if you have no formal contract or relation.  If he wishes to touch you, it would generally be unwise to resist.  If he seeks your favor, consider his intentions carefully.  He has limits, but they are... far more nebulous then those you have, as a woman.  Ah, always perform reverence to men, Toreans will expect that.&quot;

She smiles.  &quot;I have read of how things are where you come from.  Remember that it is *very* different here.  There is no equality, and it is the rare woman indeed who is superior to any male.&quot;

[[Torei&#39;s culture is strange, but... &quot;I understand.&quot;-&gt;IsPlayE Hub]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="187" name="PlayOutfit" tags="" position="920,9150" size="100,100">&quot;What Torei is *known* for,&quot; Isabella declares.  &quot;But a practice few offworlders ever try to truly understand.  They come to Torei with their preconceptions, their love of a liberty they hold to dearly.&quot;

Her white teeth gleam from behind red.  &quot;The stories of wayward tourists falling into slavery are common enough, and popular... but what surprises most is how many slaves entered their collars *willingly*.  It is not an easy life, mind you, but there are protections that come with service.  Privileges, too.  Be that financially, spiritually, or with regards to relationships... the possibilities are endless.&quot;

(if: $Slave is true)[Your instructor for the hour eyes your outfit.  &quot;And you&#39;re already closer then most freewombs to that life.&quot;]

&quot;Regardless,&quot; she concludes.  &quot;The moral of this story is that you cannot understand slavery on Torei, not yet.  You need to live among-- or within-- it for sometime.  Nothing beats practical experience.&quot;

[[&quot;I understand.-&gt;IsPlayE Hub]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="188" name="PlayETest" tags="" position="1032,9265" size="100,100">&quot;Are you?&quot;  She asks, tapping the top of the bench with a gloved finger.  &quot;I suppose we shall see about that.  I will ask you five simple questions, and you will respond to them.  This will not simply be rout memorization, mind you, I will require you extrapolate what we discussed.  Each one you get right, I&#39;ll give you ten credits.  If not... well, I still hope you will have learned *something.*&quot;  

She reaches into her purse again, pulling forth a small remote.  That she had added to your outfit suddenly seems a lot more suspicious.

&quot;Is that understood?&quot;

[[&quot;Yes, I understand.&quot;-&gt;IsQ1]]
[[&quot;...yes.&quot;-&gt;IsQ1]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="189" name="PlayImprov" tags="" position="1146,9048" size="100,100">Isabella turns to the topic readily.  &quot;The Ministry of Improvements, yes... this one is less strictly about etiquette, but important for someone in your position to know, nevertheless.  Like most other Ministries on Torei, the Ministry of Improvements operates in many Ringdoms and provides a particular service: alteration of the human body.

&quot;I do not intend to provide you with a history lesson, but suffice it to say that Torei has far more advanced medical technology then the galaxy abroad, due to the presence of the AIs.  Thus the improvement of our bodies is largely seen as a trivial matter.  Simple aesthetic changes are common, adjusting your breasts or hips for instance, or the color of your eyes.  Few Toreans retain their strictly natural attributes for long after their majority,&quot; she notes.  &quot;Especially slaves.  Improving *them* is almost a requirement, if one wishes to impress among high society.  A woman should fill out her catsuit in all the right ways, after all.&quot;

(if: $Brand is true)[The seated woman looks to you.  &quot;Your heels, for example?  The Ministry of Improvements could adjust your feet, your tendons.  Allow you to wear ballets for weeks at a time.  Or... the Ministry could make changes that *require* you wear them to walk properly.&quot;]

She shrugs.  &quot;The Ministry of Improvements can get quite... intensive, as well.  Gender modifications, non-human additions such as tails, antlers, what have you... your imagination is often the limit.  Or that of a slave&#39;s owner, at least.&quot;

Even those with wealth, such as myself, interact with them carefully.&quot;

She shrugs.  &quot;The occasional fool gets something from the polar AIs, through their Daemons.  They are the originator of the technology, after all.  But it rarely ends well for them.&quot;

But that does not matter, not when you&#39;re in a public place as I described.  He is a free male, and you are a woman.  You must give him full reverence.  Skirt up, eyes down, bow.  If not for his sake, then for your own.  You never know who is watching, and business deals have fallen through for far lesser breaches of etiquette then it getting around that you do not respect men in such a manner.&quot;

A bit of a flourish is made as she holds out the small remote.  Before you can inquire as to its purpose, she presses the singular button-- and a sharp shock runs through your collar(if: $Level is 3 or 4)[ and your pierced nipples.]  You nearly jump out of your heels in surprise, shaking your neck (if: $Level is 3 or 4)[and breasts] to escape the lingering ache emanating from the experience.

Isabella only shakes her head.  &quot;You must do better then that.  Now, as to the answer, the Ministry of Improvements is *not* free, but here on Torei the technology is good enough that many procedures are very inexpensive.

She tips her head to the side, retaking her seat along the way.  &quot;I hope this proved to be... a learning experience?  Even without your memory situation, the way we educate offworlders is shameful.  Each and every one of you should be taught how to perform a reverence, at the very least...&quot;

She waves a hand, dismissing the frustration.  You sense its a long held one.  &quot;If you need anything else, I will be here.&quot;

[[A learning experience indeed.-&gt;Isabella Hub]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="203" name="IsSlavePath II" tags="" position="1155,8635" size="100,100">Looking down, she flicks perhaps the barest hint of dust from her laminate outfit.  Or perhaps it is to hide the slight smile that forms?

&quot;My Freewomb train pass is in my name only.  I cannot simply give it to you, nor would I particularly want to.  As I said, I do not *do* charity.  But...&quot;

She looks back up to you, now *clearly* smiling.  &quot;My train pass does allow for my taking along personal belongings.  Two pieces of luggage,&quot; she pats the purse at her side, &quot;...and a slave.&quot;

Isabella watches your reaction intently.  &quot;I am traveling to downtown Grand Aekora anyway, and would allow you to complete whatever business you have in the city.  But you would be doing so under a proper slave collar and term of service.  After you complete whatever you intend to do in the city, you will serve out your service contract with me.  Standard issue, in all respects.  I&#39;ve come to learn offworlders are best enslaved under such contracts, less paperwork.  The shortest standard slave contract is for six weeks-- with extensions, of course, if necessary or desired.&quot;

She runs a hand up through her hair.  &quot;I wouldn&#39;t just offer this to anyone, mind you.  I have a soft spot for offworlders, sure... but I thought there might be something... the moment we passed in the hotel hallway. (if: $PlayE or $PlayP is true)[Playing with you only confirmed it.]&quot;

[[&quot;What... what else can you tell me about this offer?&quot;-&gt;IsSlavePathQ]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="204" name="IsSlaveEND" tags="Isabella-Special" position="9304,11731" size="100,100">&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/yNfV45r.jpg&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; height=&quot;50%&quot;&gt;

Led through the neighborhood one last time, this trip is altogether different-- you do so on a leash, your newly minted Mistress leading you.  She sets a harsh pace as well, despite the strictures of your slave suit, her steel-clad heels snapping sharply with every step.  

Reaching the Transport Platform she leads you up, then takes the lead dealing with the Transit attendant and Truant Officer manning the last checkpoint before the trains themselves.  Where once you may have had to offer payment or negotiate with the Officer, now Isabella handles it all, even presenting your SLAVE-marked ID when prompted.  

&quot;Remember to keep it on that leash,&quot; the Officer reminds your owner as together you&#39;re waved through.

Again Isabella leads the way as you approach the sleek trains, boarding a car she chooses.  The seats within are situated with tables between every two, forming small, intimate booths.  Sliding into one, she forces you down with a sharp tug on your leash.

&quot;Slaves kneel, they rarely sit,&quot; she explains, crossing her legs beneath the table.  It lends to the pensive posture she takes, leaning forward to examine you more closely.

&quot;Eyes down,&quot; she commands first, before continuing.  &quot;We need to discuss our business downtown.&quot;

Outside, the train plunges off the platform, following the rails down beneath the city.

[[&quot;Yes, Mistress.&quot;-&gt;Slave Train]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="205" name="IsSlavePath Refuse" tags="" position="1111,8812" size="100,100">&quot;I understand,&quot; Isabella replies readily.  &quot;And that is, honestly, the expected response.  But if you change your mind...&quot;

She shrugs.  &quot;Just ask me again.&quot;

[[You&#39;re not ready for that, at all.-&gt;Isabella Hub]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="206" name="IsSlavePathQ" tags="" position="1270,8807" size="100,100">The seated Mistress&#39; smile only widens.  &quot;I *knew* you&#39;re something special.  As I said, this would be a standard contract, one that would keep you here on planet until it is dismissed.  My family is quite wealthy, and I do live comfortably.  So would you, by freewomb standards certainly.  You can look up the details if you like, but in short: you would be *mine*.  Your rights, your body, the work you do, even your dress-- those would be mine to decide.  And let me be clear: I would not go easy on you, just because you&#39;re an offworlder.  You would be a slave by *my* standards.  *Torean* standards.  I can tell you right now, at the very least, I would be taking you to the Ministry of Improvements.&quot;

She gestures your way.  (if: $Slave is true)[Speaking of your dress, I would keep you in the standardized gear you&#39;re wearing now.  At least for a few weeks.  It&#39;s a good learning experience, you would need to earn the *right* to a proper identity as a slave.  After that... well, I have a very large wardrobe.&quot;](else:)[Speaking of dress, I would need a show of commitment before I did anything with you.

If we found the situation agreeable, and you renewed-- or were furthered through punishment clauses, though?  I would have your proportions filled out a bit more.  You&#39;re quite curvy for an offworlder, but this is Torei-- we have higher standards then whatever passes for acceptable beyond the Way Up.  A set of Rainbow implants, of course. Eye and hair color adjustments, probably.  And perhaps a Torean hormonal cycle, after some time.  You think the feeling of laminate and bindings are overwhelming now?  Just wait until you&#39;ve got our sensitivity and libido.&quot;

(set: $debtShower to true)
Her glossy shoulders shrug.  &quot;I want you to think about it.  Roam around the area, speak to others, get different views of Torei.  If this *really* interests you, (if: $Slave is true)[come back after awhile, and confirm your intention with me. I&#39;ll have your contract drawn up at the local Ministry of Wombs by then.](else:)[you need to tell me you want the full slave suit.  And even then... if you get cold feet, I understand.

Substantial.  A long silence follows, before she seems to reach a conclusion.

&quot;If we play, if you learn pleasure and ettiquete as we discussed... then I will talk more about this.  Not before.&quot;

[[&quot;I understand.&quot;-&gt;Isabella Hub]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="210" name="GetSlave" tags="" position="1180,8477" size="100,100">For once she doesn&#39;t turn to regard you, instead watching the passersby.

&quot;You sure?&quot;

[[&quot;N-No.&quot;-&gt;Isabella Hub]]
[[&quot;I&#39;m sure.&quot;-&gt;GetSlave2]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="211" name="Slave Commit" tags="" position="1130,8221" size="100,100">The words pass your lips, but there time seems to slow.  Your memory may be shot full of holes, but the further back you go the clearer it is.  Thousands of worlds are out there, billions of human beings.  Going about their lives, perhaps traveling, certainly choosing to do as they willed.

And you&#39;re about to reject that.  Isabella had promised to let you finish your last deal, if you desired, but there would be no trimphant escape from Torei via the Way Up afterward.  A contract would make your mere presence in the massive terminal at its base illegal-- slaves were strictly prohibited, you remember seeing a sign that declared that.  Some in the position you&#39;re so close to had to have tried to run, then, for such a sign to even be necessary.  It&#39;s not hard to imagine why they would try.

A Torean slave did not have many rights.  Isabella would keep you bound, in laminate.  She would alter your body to suit her whims.  And what if you resisted?  You would be punished until you complied.

&quot;Here on Torei, certain things are still on laminate paper,&quot; she announces, breaking your revelry.  In her hands she holds a glossy piece of thin-stamped laminate, as black as her outfit and your suit, line after line of white writing apparent upon it.

&quot;If you have any other questions before we do this, now would be the time.  Or if you would like to do anything else by yourself, you should do that first.  There is not going back.&quot;

[[&quot;I do have questions.&quot;-&gt;SlaveHub]]
[[&quot;I can&#39;t do this right now, let me think about this...-&gt;Isabella Hub]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="212" name="GetSlave2" tags="" position="1296,8624" size="100,100">Her attention snaps to you immediately.  &quot;That&#39;s what I like to hear.  Follow me.&quot;

Rising in a flourish of black laminate, Isabella leads you around the corner of the raised transit platform, talking as she walks.  &quot;As we discussed, you&#39;re committing to nothing more then the suit at this time.  You can always back out on our proposed contract until it is signed, remember that.&quot;

A large opening leads down into an area excavated beneath, a sign over which reads *Pubic Facilities*.  Those facilities turn out to be several bathrooms, one marked for Men, one for Freewombs, and one for Slaves-- alongside a row of Wardrobe Devices.  Changing outfits after or just prior to a trip seems to be common.

Isabella selects an open Wardrobe for you, using her own credentials to bring up a far more extensive catalog of options then you had seen at the Hotel.  She pays a substantial fine for the early removal of your current outfit, the brief look at her account showing a *very* large balance.  Meanwhile, a warning flashes in response to her selection of the standardized slave suit:

*This is a standardized Slave-Rated Wardrobe outfit, as described in the Aekoran Slave Codes, Chapter 812, subsection 10.  Wearing this uniform will subject all Slaves to High Protocol Laws as described in the Aekoran Slave Code, Chapter 679.  Freewombs wearing this uniform will be subjected to portions of the Slave Code, and certain liberties may be revoked.*

She dismisses it with a smile.  &quot;Ready?&quot;

[[Step in.-&gt;GetSlave3]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="213" name="GetSlave3" tags="" position="1427,8745" size="100,100">You know the drill by this point, the arms the emerge once the door closes behind you almost like old friends.  They grip your wrists, your ankles, and your throat as the machine truly revs up.  The first step is a simple one, demonstrating the utility of the drain beneath you: a solvant dissolves your suit, your bindings, everything-- in a matter of seconds.  Only metals or other installed compponents remain, but those are plucked by a pair of waiting arms as they fall to the floor.  Recycling!

The urge is there to close your eyes, as if ignorance could prevent what was about to occur.  Is this *really* what you wanted?  But your confidence holds, allowing you the only seat in the house as the show begins. Further mechanical arms and implements emerge, the largest being a ring wide enough that it barely fit the small room.  It hovers above you, a far too large halo, waiting only for an attendant arm to strategically place your blonde hair before the device descends.

Nozzles built into the ring emit a pungent substance as soon as it descends past the crown of your head.  For a moment you think it paint, and it does adhere like the stuff, but the sensation is fleeting-- as following the emitters a white-light laser passes over the freshly applied material, and it flash-cools.  What had been a thick spray is now a thin, slick, glossy material.  Holes at your mouth, nose, and eyes are quickly excised.  Cold upon your skin, but already your body is warming it up.  Torei&#39;s all but sacred material, its most readily available substance: **laminate.**

Thus your suit is quiet literally printed on, the base layer a solid midnight black.  The ring descends bit by bit, rendering soft flesh into equally soft but so very *different* laminate.  Secondary arms follow it down, providing spot treatment along seams and friction points-- although often the effect is for merely aesthetic purposes.  Sometimes that takes the form of a second application of laminate, other times it lingers to produce something more substantial-- such as the zipper between your legs, the tiny metal components pre-formed and merely placed by the rapid-fire staccato movements of a particuarly agile mechanized arm.

You&#39;re given no time to rest as the base layer concludes, the ring rapidly ascending as other arms move into the space to begin work on the most intensive component of your outfit: the corset.  Several times the arms work along your midsection, printing in thick black material, before pre-forged strips of steel emerge.  Those would be the bones that ensured a corset could trim the waist effectively, and once submerged into the thick material a final flash of light sets the material.  Its not until synthetic lacing is carefully worked in a pattern through the holes along your back that the device actually begins to function, however.  With every tug it grows tighter, never painful, but definitely uncomfortable.  By the time the Wardrobe concludes, your chest is thrust out in response, while your back is straight and breathing takes some effort.

[[And it only continues...-&gt;Get Slave 4B]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="214" name="Get Slave 4" tags="" position="1519,8895" size="100,100">No.  One last accessory remains, having been listed on the original selection as... **inserts**.

Adrenaline shoots through your system as the Wardrobe realigns itself again, this time positioning two large arms, one before your lower torso, the other just behind it.  Long, thick cylinder-like forms begin to extrude from the arms, taking the shape of what you recognize quite immediately as masculine physiology.  As they work, another more nimble arm presses forward, seizing upon the only zipper on your suit.  A mathematically simple arc carries it down between your legs, exposing a set of holes matched so perfectly to the now fully formed dildos.  Your body tenses as a syrup-like lubricant is applied to each.

(set: $Slave to true)(set: $Blue to false)(set: $Smoke to false)(set: $Sec to false)(set: $Brand to false)(set: $Gear to 5)

[[Focus on your breathing.-&gt;GetSlave 5]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="215" name="GetSlave 5" tags="" position="1569,9045" size="100,100">No further warning is given.  With sudden explosive action, the inserts drive forward.  They find the waiting holes readily enough, then twist, as if screwing their way into your body.  Despite yourself a moan escapes your ruby red (and masked) lips as you&#39;re pierced from both ends.  They plunge further, and further-- your mind screams for an end, your body assures you it cannot take anymore.  Yet it does.  Still further, further, further...

Until you&#39;re hilted on the ends, hips swaying minutely as you try fruitlessly to adapt to the sensation.  It may be amusing in restrospect, if you ever allow yourself to remember this moment, how gentle the final arm is that pulls your zipper closed again.  A small padlock on the end is almost an afterthought.

Then, with a final flash of white light and a conclusive hiss, the armatures withdraw.

You collapse to your knees, the short distance an altogether new experience as your inserts shift deep within your cunt and rear.  Again you moan, this time frustrated with yourself as you try to focus, breathing hard against the stricture of your mask.  It takes several minutes, but eventually you find yourself watching the tight, glossy material covering your chest gently rise and fall.  Your posture is ensured by the corset, while also making each breath a bit of an effort, at least until your body adapted.  The sensation of the laminate is almost otherwordly as well, light pressure upon your body from toe to head, a lover&#39;s embrace you cannot escape.  Excepting the zipper between your legs (and that is locked), there is no point of entrance, no direct break in the experience.  Only smooth laminate, and the labored sound of your own breathing.

Running a hand down the slick material reveals laminate to laminate contact to be almost frictionless.  It&#39;s almost too easy to forget your own hand as it glides along your thigh-- as a strong compulsion draws the limb inward, towards the nexus of your legs.  You resist... for the moment.  Instead you struggle back to your feet, biting your lip, pelvis thrusting slightly in reaction to the sensations within.  Your heels do not help matters, the effect of being forced onto your toes one that will certainly take some effort to combat.

(if: $Level is &gt; 0)[It&#39;s then that the armatures return, one last brief experience as you&#39;re pulled back up into position.  Did you think you were going to get our of your punishments from the hotel so easily?  They&#39;re rebuilt in short order, your hobble chain(if: $Level is &gt; 1)[ and armbinder] replaced by shiny black new ones.  Only then are you release for the last time.]

The Wardrobe&#39;s display flicks back into existence, a final sentence emerging upon it.

*Your dressing order has now been completed.  If this machine is functioning under slave protocols, you may be held until a legally recognized owner or agent arrives to collect you.  Otherwise, the door will open shortly.  Watch your step, and enjoy...*

The doors open as promised, allowing you to shuffle awkwardly back out into the dim light of the far corridor.  Isabella awaits expectantly.

[[Make your way there.-&gt;Get Slave 6]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="216" name="Get Slave 6" tags="" position="1571,9195" size="100,100">She does not spare your body her hands, the black laminate of her gloves gliding so effortlessly over your own obsidian form as she examines every detail.  Your breath catches in your throat, nearly choking you considering how little oxygen the mask seemed to allow, when her fingers glide momentarily between your legs.

&quot;I can barely tell its *you* in there,&quot; she declares, seemingly quite satisfied.  &quot;You&#39;re really going to struggle with that, I can tell already.  Good.&quot;

She steps back, if only to take you all in at once.  Your new corset forces your chest out while emphasizing the curve from hip to waist, forming a silhouette as provacative as it is lewd.  (if: $Level is 2)[The armbinder only furthers the effect(if: $Level is 3 or 4)[ while your pierced nipples are hidden only until light rolls across your chest, the steel nubs pressing against your laminate].]

Isabella&#39;s hands collect together, she seems almost proud.  &quot;Well, there we are.  As I promised, those locks you&#39;re wearing are time-sensative right now.  You can walk back up that ramp and never see me again, if you like.&quot;

Her red lips form into a smile.  &quot;But if you still want the contract... I want you to explore, talk to others nearby.  Get different views of what Torei can be. And if you *still* want it... come back to me.  We will take a walk to the nearest Ministry of Wombs office, then.&quot;

You focus on your breathing as she leads you back to her bench, where she takes a seat, lighting up her electronic cigarette again.

The same thing women in your position have been signing for... hundreds of years, although quite short by most measurements.  Six weeks of guaranteed enslavement on your part.  More, if you trigger punishment clauses.  All the standard revoking of your personal liberties, as we discussed.  Including your full body rights.  My family&#39;s appendixes are applied as well, House Naram-Sin&#39;s lawyers always demand that.  Those are straightforward-- if anything would happen to me, your slave contract would pass to the House trust unless my will specifies otherwise. If you were to have any children during your time in the collar-- impossible given your term of service, but I should mention it-- boys would be raised by my House.  Girls would be enslaved upon reaching their majority.&quot;

Whatever I decide, it will be quite the change for you, I would imagine.  The Torean household has had... centuries to adapt to the precence of slaves.

From her purse she pulls forth a length of laminate cord, one end formed into a simple loop, the other a steel shackle. It&#39;s the later she hooks to the waiting ring on the front of your collar, forming a leash she uses to guide you along.  

You walk the streets of Torei as a freewomb for the last time, leashed to a woman you barely knew, on your way towards enslavement.  Even without your plugs pumping into your cunt with every step, everything that follows is something of a blur.  Perhaps you should be taking it all end, but you find yourself focusing on Isabella herself.  Her corset, the bow so primly done.  Her ass, so full and glossy, as she walks.  And the lingering scent of cinnamon, as sharp and heady as any proper intoxicant...

The Ministry of Wombs indeed have a small branch office a few blocks away.  You&#39;re left by the door alongside several other women, each of you leashed to a series of hooks provided for just that purpose.  It takes some time, but eventually you&#39;re retrieved.  Taken into a small room, you are forced to kneel, legs spread and eyes down.  A Ministry employee takes your ID card, and then asks a series of simple questions.  Afterward, with Isabella standing above you, hand on your laminate-covered head, the Ministry employee requests you repeat after her:

Mechanical arms seize your head, holding it tight as nozzles approach your face.  A quick blast of air instinctively causes your eyes to close, and in that brief moment the Wardrobe does its work.  Your eyelids have been darkened and your eyelashes extended, producing an alluring effect.  And your lips are now a bright red coloration, an interesting detail given what comes next.

That would be your mask, listed for *breath regulation*.  You already have been provided with a thin hood much akin to the rest of your catsuit, but this secondary mask is much thicker, several armatures working together to forge it upon your face.  A handful of metal components are integrated as well, but your field of vision had already been restricted enough that you barely notice.  Indeed, before you know it a curved glass panel is being placed just before your eyes, the laminate seals along the edge flash-cooling.

Your next breath, the first within your new enclosed environment, is thus harder.  *Much* harder.  You gasp, trying to suck in enough oxygen-- only for your corset&#39;s constriction to assert itself.  It&#39;s a devious combination, one you would have almost certainly cursed had not the machine (and thus your own focus) already shifted elsewhere.

Several attending arms move back up to your throat, casting thick laminate in yet another layer until several steel segments (much like those trimming your waist) are sunk into the material.  The Wardrobe was ensuring your head remained up, but you&#39;re hit with the immediate sensation that was no longer necessary-- the collar would ensure your posture going forward.

Yet another componenent of your outfit comes with the sensation of your own feet rising, the sensation unequal and primarily at your heel.  Without the restraint arms you would have toppled over, but they hold you tight, tall stilleto heels and a thick platform for your toes being extruded into place.  Black laminate follows, coating your feet and providing the anchor on which laces are quickly assembled.

To be on your knees, in laminate from head to toe, giving away your rights word by word...

It ends with a congratulations from the employee, who returns your ID card before leaving.  *Freewomb* is still visible along the top, but over the red letters in bold black print something new has been stamped: **SLAVE.**

(if: $Level is 3 or 4)[&quot;Perhaps most immediately, we do provide financial assistance for the early removal of debt-related... adjustments, made to any woman.

Were it up to us this would be provided free of charge, our donations covering the early-release fees... but Torean law does not allow debt assumption of that sort.  You will need to pay for a *portion* of the cost yourself.  But it&#39;s very small!  50 credits for your, ah, chest-- 50 more to have your arms released, and a final 50 for the hobble chain!&quot;](if: $Level is 2)[&quot;Perhaps most immediately, we do provide financial assistance for the early removal of debt-related... adjustments, made to any woman.

The man rests his hands on his hips.  &quot;I could certainly provide financial assistance from my small personal stipend, if you were willing to help with some of our awareness campaigns-- there are three opportunities right there!  First, we&#39;re collecting interviews from freewombs such as yourself who are living on this planet.  I&#39;d give you 25 credits for that.  Second, we&#39;re collecting pictures as well-- although given the nature of those I could pay quite a bit more... say 100 credits?  And there is one more, although it requires a bit of walking... and you are in those heels.  Are those comfortable?  Nevermind.  What it entails, anyway, is asking for donations from anyone of importance around here.  You would be given another 100 credits for that.&quot;

He rubs his hands together.  &quot;So-- what can I do for you?&quot;

[[Opportunities about!-&gt;Offworlder Hub]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="238" name="OffNip" tags="" position="2430,8218" size="100,100">For a moment, he looks to your chest, but quickly draws his gaze back up to meet your eyes.  &quot;I&#39;m deeply sorry you had to undergo the application of such things,&quot; Michael commiserates.  He sounds quite genuine.

&quot;If you&#39;re capable of paying that small 50 credit fee, I can get those removed for you.  And even if you don&#39;t have the credits right now, I want you to know there is no shame in being outfitted with... *them.*  On Torei, it&#39;s a very common thing for women-- slaves and Freewombs alike-- to eventually be *improved*, as a Torean would declare, in such a way.  And as things go, they&#39;re... relatively minor.  The Society has helped-- if you will excuse my using the Torean term-- *painslut* with far more then what you&#39;re enduring.&quot;

I hope no one has tried to take advantage of you either, with your arms pinned like that it&#39;s so hard to do *anything.*&quot;

Mission goals and achievements, financial spending, that sort of thing.  But we also have a section reserved for what we call *the voices of Torei*.  Testamonies from the Torean-born, or freewombs like yourself.  Anyone who has been subjected to the horrors of Torean culture!  Wait here.&quot;

Moving to his backpack, he pulls forth a small recording device and a datapad of some sort.  Tapping a button, he peforms a quick microphone check, the machine repeating his words with a second press.  Clearly working as intended, he approaches you again.  &quot;So, let me explain how this works-- it&#39;s really simple.  I will ask you a few questions, and you will answer the questions truthfully.  And I mean that-- don&#39;t say what you think the Society wants to hear, speak from your heart.

He smiles, awfully handsome in the afternoon light.  &quot;So-- how does that sound?  Pretty easy, right?  And then you will get your 25 credits.  I only wish I was authorized to give you more.&quot;

[[&quot;Is this anonymous?  Will my name be attached, I mean?&quot;-&gt;OffInterviewPreQ]]
[[&quot;This sounds like something I can do.  Give me the first question.&quot;-&gt;OffInterviewQ1]]
[[&quot;I&#39;ll have to rethink this, Michael.

A *&#39;but&#39;* was coming, and it doesn&#39;t take long.

&quot;But we&#39;re aware it&#39;s a substantial enough sum.  There is a reason for that.&quot;  He pulls at his jacket&#39;s collar a bit, obviously uncomfortable.  &quot;The photoshoot is supposed to generate awareness for slaves and freewombs, and the bondage you undergo here.  But the local authorities are, obviously, resistant to our activities.  It is not what we would prefer, but we have managed to achieve a compromise of sorts: they allow us to operate if we ensure our photoshoots and the like show *real* Torean scenarios.  That means no actors, nothing staged.  We&#39;ve... acquired the services of a Governess, and just need volunteers to undergo her work for-- just until the photoshoot is completed!&quot;

He gives you an apologetic look.  &quot;Obviously, it can be difficult to find freewombs who are willing to become the face of Torei for hundreds of worlds, ma&#39;am.(if: $Slave is true)[  Your mask would hide your identity somewhat, of course, but your name would still be included.]  Thus the 100 credits if you help our cause.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, I think you can.  Alright, here is how this works.  All you need to do is use your natural charm--&quot; he pauses, eyeing your full laminate ensemble.  &quot;I mean *talk* to people, and ask for donations to the Society.  Usually it works best if you have a personal connection with someone, you know, that you&#39;ve done something else with them before.  So try that, explore a bit, see you can approach.&quot;

He takes you by the shoulder, a raised hand directed over the nearest rooftop.  In the distance the Transport Platform looms over most everything else in the district.  &quot;Then there is one other spot I&#39;d want you to hit.  Up on the Platform we have a permit for a small stand, for marketing or education or whatever we like.  Today it will be donation collection, with you heading it.  The literature and the signs mostly sell the idea themselves, but if anyone has any questions just encourage them to contact our hotline.  Sound good?  At the end, you come back to me, and you get a cut of whatever you collected.  Call it an incentive for good work!&quot;

[[&quot;Sounds easy enough, I&#39;m in.&quot;-&gt;OffDonateYes]]
[[&quot;Actually... let me think about it.  Maybe later.&quot;-&gt;Offworlder Hub]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="243" name="OffRemoveSuit" tags="" position="2090,8218" size="100,100">He looks over your enclosure suit with more empathy then desire, despite the way it demonstrates your every curve-- for any curious onlooker.  &quot;That suit you&#39;re wearing... it&#39;s a travesty, I must say that first.  Between inventive Masters and the Ministry of Improvements, *much* worse fates can be found here on Torei, but there is something to be said for the ubiquity and effectiveness of your particular uniform.  It&#39;s designed to remove your identity, to make you just another black masked *doll*.  To have you focus on your body, your breath, your... desire, and not much else.&quot;

You have to agree with the effectiveness.  Were you given a bit of privacy, you&#39;re not sure if you could have resisted grinding your plugged cunt against the nearest solid thing.  Even then, in public like this, you find yourself constantly shifting your hips.  It&#39;s a lingering symptom Michael notices as well, but he only shakes his head slightly.

&quot;I can get you out of it early-- but there are... complications.  The first being cost.  The Society can pay for your early emancipation, but Aekoran law requires that you pay an attendant fine yourself-- it&#39;s *clearly* designed to make just this sort of thing more difficult.  200 Credits is not easy to scrape together, not for a slave suited woman.  But if you bring me that, I can take you to a wardrobe and get you changed in something... still laminate, but as professional as can be managed.  Skirt, blouse, heels... you&#39;re a woman on Torei, you best get used to heels.&quot;

[[&quot;I don&#39;t have that many credits.  Perhaps we can explore this later.-&gt;Offworlder Hub]]

I mean, look around you.  Look at yourself.  It is... very distracting.&quot;

He looks out towards the other women walking past, a riot of colors and gloss.  &quot;It would be so easy... you girls are all but *required* to give me whatever I desire.  The way it&#39;s expected that you perform reverence, the opportunities that come every night as your curfew starts... it&#39;s why the Society focuses on women exclusively.  Torei is not easy on you.&quot;

The taller man sighs a bit, shaking off the malaise with a spirited display of focus.  &quot;I manage by keeping myself seperate.  No laminate whatsoever, even if finding laundry for textiles is... difficult.  And I focus on our mission.  The Ministry of Truants is...&quot;

He smiles, looking away.  &quot;Let&#39;s talk about something else.&quot;

I arrived here by train, in fact.  We of the Society refuse to patronize the carriages, and our cause is so much more necessary here-- a bit further from the Way Up.  I&#39;d love to try again in the Antipodes, but if you think the cause is difficult here-- imagine Ringdoms with archaic technology, where Offworlders are so rare they don&#39;t even think to *question* slavery...&quot;

Clearly its unthinkable to the man, and he brushes off any attempt to discuss the matter further.  Besides, he hadn&#39;t exactly answered your question.  &quot;A pass, though.  I do have one, but it&#39;s reserved for someone else.  That&#39;s all I can say about it.&quot;

You don&#39;t have to travel far-- Michael leads you down a nearby alley and through a door within.  You enter into what appears to be an office space of some sort, subdivided and rented out.  The Liberty Society&#39;s section is small, and currently deserted, but packed with supplies-- you get the clear impression Michael isn&#39;t its only member operating on Grand Aekora&#39;s outskirts.  Passing by several boxes of pamphlets much like the ones your escort had been handing out, you notice one of a different style, the name *Convent of Perception* written in stark letters along the top.

Your attention turns towards the back of the domicile, however, where a familiar device awaits-- a wardrobe, this one appearing to be mobile.  Michael works the control panel as you step up, the door gliding open before you.  Within, a dozen different armatures await.

[[Step forward.-&gt;Remove Suit 3]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="247" name="Remove Suit 3" tags="" position="2089,8519" size="100,100">You&#39;re seized as soon as you enter, the door snapping shut behind.  Much like the hotel&#39;s Wardrobe, this one has a drain in the bottom of the unit, its use revealed by the first stage of your re-dressing-- the removal.  Instead of peeling the laminate from your body, a simple solvant is applied by a spraying arm, and in mere moments the material is dripping off your body like so much wet paint.  

Removing your plugs is a different matter-- that requires a pair of arms to seize them directly, but as you squirm in your restraints they&#39;re pulled free from your tortured cunt.  You take a deep breath, the first in some time, as you are no longer masked.  A brief, tantalizing taste of nudity follows... but not for long.  With a fresh whirl, the Wardrobe begins working on your new outfit as a ring descends from above.

Thus your outfit is quiet literally printed on, first applying bright white but transitioning to an equally vibrant shade of red as it passes your waist and forms a stylish pencil skirt.  The ring descending bit by bit, rendering soft flesh into equally soft but so very *different* laminate.  Secondary arms follow it down, providing spot treatment along seams and friction points-- although often the effect is for merely aesthetic purposes.  Sometimes that takes the form of a second application of laminate, other times it lingers to produce something more substantial-- such as the small folded collar just beneath your chin, or the buttons that almost immediately strain to keep your bust constained by your bodice.

You&#39;re given no time to rest as the base layer concludes, the ring rapidly ascending as other arms move into the space to begin work on your accessories.  The peplum skirt you saw pictured is thus formed, starting with the belt at your waist.  Small pre-forged rivets are sunk into the still molton laminate before it is sealed, as is the belt loop that is seated directly over your naval.  Still held in place, small arms flair the laminate that extends over your rear, achieving the look most of the galaxy would label as *slutty* but Torei saw as merely coquettish.

The final componenent of your outfit comes with the sensation of your own feet rising, the sensation unequal and focused primarily at your heel.  Without the restraint arms you would have toppled over, but they hold you tight, tall heels being extruded into place.  More red laminate follows, coating your feet excepting the stylish hole at the very front.

Almost as an afterthought, makeup is applied last.  Mechanical arms seize your head, holding it tight as nozzles approach your face.  A quick blast of air instinctively causes your eyes to close, and in that brief moment the Wardrobe does its work.  Your eyelids have been darkened, a crimson secondary coat added that flashed only when light slid across it.  Pores and blemishes have been rendered impotent as well, while your cheekbones have been highlighted.  And your lips are now a poignant, inviting red.

(if: $Level is &gt; 0)[The only remaining step is the reapplication of your bondage, the hobble chain at your ankles (if: $Level is &gt; 1)[and armbinder behind you] being quickly build back up.]

Then, with a final flash of white light and a conclusive hiss, the armatures withdraw.

[[You emerge.-&gt;Remove Suit 4]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="248" name="Remove Suit 4" tags="" position="2133,8667" size="100,100">&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/mEoSzB3.jpg&quot; width=&quot;30%&quot; height=&quot;30%&quot;&gt;
(set: $Status to 1)(set: $Gear to 3)
You step back out of the wardrobe, utterly transformed.  Once more you&#39;re allowed to breathe freely, regulation no longer being applied by mask and corset.  You&#39;ve also been liberated from the consistent teasing of the infernal plugs, although curiously your tortured womanhood almost seems to ache from their absence.  Most importantly, though, you will no longer be recognized as little better then a slave-- the outfit you&#39;re now wearing instead at least approaches the Torean definition of *professional.*

It&#39;s a change that Michael clearly approves of immediately, a fact he demonstrates by giving you an enthusiastic thumbs up.

&quot;Very good!  I wish we had more offworld textiles to give you, I know, but this will have to do.  I&#39;m sure I don&#39;t have to remind you, but... do watch how you sit, ma&#39;am.  That outfit does not come with panties.&quot;

He gestures for you to follow, and leads you back out into the alley, and then the street beyond.  His corner is much as you had left it, except for the half-circle of passersby avoiding Michael&#39;s attempts to speak with them-- something he is quick to reconstitute, returning to his job.

With outfits, we generally have to go to a wardrobe to have something removed.  But accessories?  I can cut that off you in just a few moments.  I bet that would feel *quite* good, huh?  Having every step restricted like that, I would imagine it must be easy to fall over.  And forget about running, or anything else that requires more then walking speed.&quot;

Going to his backpack, he returns with a particularly heavy-duty looking set of shears.  &quot;You will still need to pay that 50 credit fee, of course.&quot;

Starting just behind your left shoulder, he slides the blade beneath the laminate, then works it upward.  The muscles and tendons that are freed from the enforced position behind your back nearly spasm from the sudden liberty, but already you can feel the harsh ache in your arms finally peak and begin to start coming down.

Michael is all smiles, as he tosses the laminant remains in a nearby recycling chute.  &quot;Great!  Remember-- we can address that hobble chain now, if you have another 50 credits.  If not, don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll be here all day.&quot;

A healing solution is applied afterward, intended to repair your nipples now that they&#39;re no longer studded.  Beyond that, you merely must wait for the suit to reproduce the laminate across your chest-- and you&#39;re free, emerging to Michael waiting expectantly.

The Society is required to get sign off from the Governess to use this material afterward, and... knowing their sort&#39;s reputation, she will be thorough in what she deems a proper representation of Torean culture.  I very much doubt she will ask for further consent, or harbor much of what one would call mercy.  A Torean Governess is fearsome indeed.&quot;

We will need to move to the Society&#39;s local operating base.  Governess Yennifer should already be there, working with the two other girls.&quot;

Michael grabs his backpack, slinging it casually over one shoulder as he leads the way.  &quot;Oh, did I not mention the other girls?  Obviously, we&#39;re trying to get a few different volunteers.  Different perspectives, reactions, things like that.&quot;

He leads you through the streets, the passing crowds of women parting before him-- at least it&#39;s easy to follow in his wake.  Eventully you divert into an alley, then a door that enters into what appears to be an office space of some sort, subdivided and rented out.  The Liberty Society&#39;s section is small, and currently deserted, but packed with supplies-- you get the clear impression Michael isn&#39;t its only member operating on Grand Aekora&#39;s outskirts.  Passing by several boxes of pamphlets much like the ones your escort had been handing out, you notice one of a different style, the name *Convent of Perception* written in stark letters along the top.

Your attention turns towards one of the myriad side doors, however, as Michael leads you through several.  After the third, you come face to face with another woman waiting beside yet another door, her expression troubled.  Her dress is black, and she looks worried.
(set: $debt to it +100)(set: $debtSlave to true)(set: $TruantQuestPamph to true)
&quot;Are they nearly done?&quot; Michael greets.

The woman shakes her head.  &quot;She hasn&#39;t even allowed the cameras to start yet, hells-- it&#39;s been three hours for the first girl, nearly two for the second.  That... *harpy* says she has to get the girls warmed up.  Michael, I do *not* like this.&quot;

Michael only sighs again, a hand gently on your back as he guides you towards the door.  &quot;Just head on in,&quot; he instructs you, opening the final door.  As you step through, he moves towards the woman, most of his words lost as he lowers his voice.

&quot;...for the best... knew she would be harsh... can only help keep tourists away...&quot;

Well, many households and organizations on this planet can get very large.  And Torean culture, regrettably, generally involves a variety of unconscionable things be done to women associated with, working in, or enslaved by those groups.  Obviously leaders, be they CEOs or household heads, cannot manage such practices wholely by themselves.  Thus the Governess-- they&#39;re usually enslaved themselves, but serve as overseers.&quot;

[[&quot;That makes sense, I suppose.  Should we get to it?&quot;-&gt;OffPhoto3]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="268" name="OffPhoto4" tags="" position="2845,8604" size="100,100">&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ueFwYim.jpg&quot;&gt;

&quot;What do we have here...?&quot;  The voice rings out as you enter a larger room, the majority of it draped with a heavy white laminate tarp.  Pulled tight along the walls and floor, it serves as a stage towards which a half-dozen cameras are arrayed.  They sit idly, but the woman who had addressed you is anything but.

Her outfit is uniformally black, a long sleeved laminate leotard that exposes plenty of the pale flesh between her hips and the knee high boots she is perched upon.  The cut of the outfit is low, exposing the tops of her breasts, a heavy strap running just above them.  Above *that* she is securely collared, a hint of submission amongst so much dominance.

(if: $Strike is &gt;= 8)[&quot;Ah,&quot; she purrs, her advance towards you marked by a bold stride and snapping heels.  Her bright red lips curl into a smile, the one hint of color between her uniform and black hair.  &quot;I *know* you.  We met on the street!  Such a small... delightful world.  And now you&#39;re another naughty slut!&quot;](else:)[&quot;Ah,&quot; she purrs, her advance towards you marked by a bold stride and snapping heels.  Her bright red lips curl into a smile, the one hint of color between her uniform and black hair.  &quot;Another naughty *slut.*&quot;]

Who she meant by &#39;another&#39; requires only a glance beyond the Governess.  In the center of the makeshift stage, three poles run from ceiling to floor.  Two are... occupied.

In the center a girl in a pink laminante dress has her hands bound behind her back, a shiny ring gag pressed between her teeth, forcing her mouth open.  The cups of her dress have been pulled down, both revealing her pierced nipples and stripping her of anything approaching dignity.  Her expression is a mixture of frustrated and distraught, but it takes you a moment to recognize *why* beyond the obvious causes-- but you eventually do notice a laminate cord, running down from the top of her pole, then down behind her back.  Just what purpose that cord served is demonstrated by the second woman.

Much like the first, this second unfortunate has her own pole, her hands bound behind her back.  Her laminate outfit is a pale blue, her breasts likewise exposed.  Unlike her compatriot in bondage, however, she isn&#39;t standing angrily-- she&#39;s *hanging*.  Her legs are folded up, straps encircling her thighs (and thus her calves), one to each side her pole.  And the cord from above?  She doesn&#39;t have a skirt to hide the fact that it was connected to a heavy device currently installed in her ass, supporting her weight entirely.  Her head is bowed, drool running from her gagged mouth to the floor.

[[&quot;Oh no.&quot;-&gt;OffPhoto5]]

She&#39;s strong, stronger then you would have expected of her.  Truly, did Torean biotechnology have any limits?

Her free hand glides over your laminate hips.  &quot;(if: $Blue is true)[Another freewomb in blue, but I do say-- the restraints on this one are quite agreeable.  The collar suits you.

She pivots, resting her arm across your shoulders.  You get the sense she has absolutely zero sense of personal space.  Together you look towards the three poles, and two bound girls.  The Governess&#39; black lips slide into a wicked grin.  &quot;Ready to join them?&quot;

She leads you forward, approaching the woman in the middle.  Raven haired and pretty, her opened mouth drools a bit onto the floor, her eyes trying to stay focused.  This much closer, you can see the telltale red marks of some device-- whip or crop-- along her flanks.  She&#39;s standing on her toes, barely, the toes of her boots barely managing to hold her steady.  That last bit, *steady*, is demonstrated to be quite important when the Governess uses her shoulder to push her to the side.  She pivots, moaning desperately, without the footing to halt the process despite her muted attempts to do so.  

&quot;Your ID indicates you&#39;re... quite new to Torei,&quot; the Governess explains, flicking the thick laminate cord to which the steel that emerged from the girl&#39;s ass attached.  The cord thrums in response, and so does your fellow freewomb, the sound pleading.  &quot;You&#39;ve probably not seen an anal hook in person, but that&#39;s what is buried inside her.  An *excellent* tool if rigged correctly.  Perfect for what those fool Offworlders think they&#39;re getting here.&quot;

The bound girl&#39;s wriggling ceases, her breathing heavy.  Her moans turn towards something else, a concerted attempt to communicate.  It sounds unintelligble to you, but the Governess has the experience to translate.

This is a breaking pole, and it&#39;s *torture*.&quot;

The final woman is as you glimpsed her before-- bound like the previous, but with her legs lifted, knees a few feet from the floor.  Supported solely by the hook, you also notice something lodged in her exposed womanhood-- the obvious base of cock, churning relentlessly.

&quot;Present,&quot; the Governess commands, and the bound girl instantly complies.  Her face is covered by the fall of her hair and she doesn&#39;t raise it now, but she does arch her back, pressing out her chest.  It&#39;s an effect that clearly takes some effort, the girl moaning lewdly.

&quot;Good *slave*.  Do you want down?&quot;

The freewomb shakes her head *no*, barely perceptible compared to the line of drool that runs down onto her own chest.  The Governess seems ready to continue, but a sharp snap suddenly sounds, replacing the hum of the vibrator lodged within the girl.  A shock.

&quot;Almost orgasmed,&quot; comes the commentary.  &quot;Come, let&#39;s get you setup on yours.&quot;

You barely make it two steps.

&quot;This isn&#39;t acceptable, but I can see you&#39;re the sort of Offworlder who *needs* this.

&quot;And now...&quot; You already know what she&#39;s reaching for before she displays it so prominantly, chromed steel glaring in the bright light of the studio lights.  A wicked, curved hook, the tip formed into a rounded ball.

&quot;There...&quot; You feel the hook reach its destination as much as you&#39;re told, the tip somewhere deep within coming to rest against flesh that normally avoided such direct stimulation.  Nerve clusters fire in response, registering pain and pleasure in strange combinations.  Yet that&#39;s only the start of it-- the feeling *builds* as she adjusts the laminate cord that linked it above, drawing you up... up... until you can barely stand on your toes.

[[&quot;Get me down from here!&quot;-&gt;OffPhoto7]]

The ring between your full (if: $Blue is true)[navy] (if: $Smoke is true)[black] (if: $Brand is true)[red] (if: $Sec is true)[red] (if: $Slave is true)[red] lips denys you the option to prevent anything being inserted into your throat.

And then you&#39;re ignored.  The Governess shifts her attention back to the girl in the middle, leaving you awkwardly bound, a line of drool running from your gagged mouth.  It&#39;s almost... frustrating?  Did you want to be freed, though, or merely the Governess&#39; attention?

It&#39;s something you consider as the pink laminated girl loses her right to stand, instead submitting to her pole completely with a moaned whimper.

Her uniform is bright blue with black streaks, a single piece that ends in a short skirt roughly halfway down her thighs.  The badge of her Ministry is clearly imprinted above her breast and on each shoulder, as well as above the brim of that hate she wears.  A tight bun corrals a considerable amount of raven hair while her auburn eyes scrutinize your identification card closely.  At her belt she wears several sets of restraints, and a heavy looking cylinder-- a military grade shock baton.

Advancing further, you lose sight of the gate-- the plot of land may be small, but the wave-like foliage seems to encompass all, smothering you in its embrace.  Stepping past a particularly thick trunk-analogue, you catch sight of movement.  A figure, kneeling in a small clearing.  Their cloak, bright red, is a blast of fresh color among so many shades of dark purple.

The red of her cloak is offset by the dark black of her catsuit, the heavy corset and strict collar (if: $Slave is true)[very much like your own.](else:)[very much like a slave&#39;s.]  Red stockings and panties offset so much darkess, as does the gag-like muzzle pulled tightly against the lower half of her head.  You notice a heavy septum piercing hanging from her nose, as well as the unmistakable markers of similarly invasive adornments to her nipples, visible so easily given how tight the laminate covering her matronly bust is.  Her hood casts a deep shadow over her eyes, but you notice they seem to be red as well-- giving her gaze an inhuman cast.

&quot;Welcome(if: $Slave is true)[, Sister].&quot;  Her voice is soft, as if each word is carefully considered.  The laminate across her lips muffles the effect somewhat.  &quot;Welcome to our Convent.&quot;

The long sleeves of her cloak allow her gloved hands to remain hidden as they entwine before her, but you catch a brief glimpse of shackles adorning each wrist.

&quot;My name is Sister Euphoria.  What is it you seek?&quot;

It matters not(if: $Slave is true)[, Sister].  All are welcome.&quot;

She pauses, those red eyes searching out your own.  When they meet, she gazes deeply, leaving you with a chill sensation running up your spine.

&quot;You intend to travel,&quot; Euphoria concludes.  &quot;But you lack the means.&quot;

You need credits?&quot;

It almost seems strange to discuss such mundanities with this almost otherworldly woman, but she takes to the topic readily.

&quot;Credits are but a means to a particular end, and perhaps not even the most appealing end available to you.  What you *need* is the opportunity to consider your situation.  The Convent can provide both.  Indulge me(if: $Slave is true)[, Sister], with a dedication towards reflection and prayer.  A few hours.  Perhaps that will help you on your path.  Even if it does not, the Convent will provide you alms.  We offer four programs of prayer: Contemplation, Sensation, and Revelation.   Contemplation and Sensation will reward you with 50 credits apiece.  Revelation another one hundred... if you make it that far.&quot;

The Vow of Anonymity we take upon entering the Order strips us of our names and past identities, and our eponym change with some frequency.&quot;

The silence of the grove you both stand in grows momentarily oppressive, thick and foreboding.  It passes as Euphoria continues.  &quot;The related Vow of Uniformity requires several stays with the Ministry of Improvements, adjusting our bodies towards identicality with each other.  Thus the red of my eyes, which it turn symbolizes yet another Vow... but I digress, theology can be quite convoluted and entwined at times.

I want to ask about something else.&quot;-&gt;AskCon]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="327" name="AskOrder" tags="" position="3921,8431" size="100,100">&quot;Our Order is old, but not very large,&quot; the Sister muses, the fullness of her chest made evident as she folds an arm beneath, resting her other on its elbow as she does some quick math with her free hand.

&quot;Perhaps five thousand, across the surface of Torei.  We *do* have a claim to being widespread, at the very least.  Serving at a Convent here, so close to the Way Up, is quite a different experience from a Convent deep in the Antipodes.&quot;

[[&quot;Interesting, I have other question.-&gt;AskCon]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="328" name="AskMen" tags="" position="3791,8548" size="100,100">&quot;Are you asking if we have male members in our Order?&quot; She asks, seeking clarification.  &quot;Or our believes regarding masculinity?&quot;

[[&quot;If you have male members.&quot;-&gt;AskMale]]
[[&quot;Your overall beliefs, regarding masculinity.&quot;-&gt;AskMasc]]
[[&quot;Actually... let me think about it, I have other questions.&quot;-&gt;AskCon]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="329" name="AskNunSlave" tags="" position="3652,8428" size="100,100">The collar in question is tight against her throat, thinner along the top and flaring a bit towards the shoulders.  It doesn&#39;t look comfortable.

&quot;You are asking if I am a slave,&quot; she deduces, tilting her head slightly to the side.  Her hood follows, running down her back like glossy hair.  &quot;I am.  All members of the Order are.&quot;

Lifting her arms allows the long sleeves to slide down somewhat, revealing cuffs locked onto her wrists.  A second set is visible on her ankles.

&quot;When a prospective Sister joins the Order as a Noviatiate, she is enslaved to our Benefactor.  It&#39;s a temporary arrangement at first, but upon one&#39;s Confirmation it is made both lifelong and irreversible.  Thus we commit ourselves wholely to the exploration of Bliss, and the rejection of Sin.  It is the Vow of Service, but just one of many we must take-- others being the Vow of Poverty, the Vow of Femininity, and the Vow of Anonymity.  There are optional ones as well, such as the Vow of Silence, or that of Chastity.&quot;  

[[&quot;Did you mention a &#39;Benefactor&#39;?&quot;-&gt;AskBenny]]
[[&quot;Interesting.  I want to ask about something else, though.&quot;-&gt;AskCon]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="330" name="AskNew" tags="" position="3785,8422" size="100,100">&quot;The Path to Bliss is always open, for those with the conviction to walk it,&quot; Euphoria replies, blinking slowly.  It&#39;s not hard to imagine she must be quite beautiful beneath that muzzle.  &quot;We offer that program, that of Conversion, here.  But it is a hard path, and most Novitiates drop out when given the opportunity just prior to Confirmation.&quot;

Her lithe shoulders rise and fall, a a serene shrug.  &quot;But if you work through our programs, and if you think you have the resolve, perhaps we could discuss it more later.&quot;

[[Not exactly a glowing endorsement, but a viable path nevertheless?  &quot;I want to ask about something else.&quot;-&gt;AskCon]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="331" name="AskPercp" tags="" position="3301,8566" size="100,100">&quot;Mhm,&quot; the red-eyed woman purrs.  &quot;A good question.  And often debated here, in these very halls.  Perception is much like a triangle, I believe.  Three sided, each component necessary to maintain the whole, but abstract and strange-- mere lines-- without the others.&quot;  

The Sister mimics drawing a triangle in the space between you, her black gloves so very dark against the red of her cloak sleeve.  &quot;The first side is how we perceive ourselves, both via the sensations we experience, and through our individual acts of judgement.  The second side is how others perceive us, and much akin to the first-- split between that which others observe, and how they react to our choices.  And the third?  That one is more... theoretical.  Difficult to grasp.  It is the sense of perception we have for what our *other* senses have already perceived.  An... esotoric concept, but one I think can be explained with an example.  Imagine you have cut your hand.  The first side is the pain you feel, and how you worry others will react to such a wound.  The second side is the *actual* reaction others have, and how they *think* you feel about the cut.  The third side, then, is how you perceive that sensation of pain, of concern for others.  Are you scared?  Ashamed?  Angry?&quot;

Her gloved hands collect again before her waist.  &quot;Thus... *perception.*&quot;

[[&quot;I see...-&gt;AskCon]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="332" name="AskSin" tags="" position="3534,8564" size="100,100">&quot;We do.&quot;  The Sister looks down at you, momentarily searching your eyes.  Whatever she&#39;s looking for, she doesn&#39;t find it.

&quot;Sin is the antithesis of bliss.  The abolisment of pleasure, dissatisfaction of the mind, or chaos in society.  It is something to avoid, to abhor from afar.  But that is not always possible, and in *those* circumstances corrective action must be taken.&quot;

It&#39;s a firm line, yet delivered without a break in the Sister&#39;s serene attitude.  &quot;We recognize the Order cannot take sides, however.  Cannot fix the world.  Thus we address only that which we can-- our Sisters.  Those outside of it we merely guide.  The same is applied to the Ringdoms we inhabit, we do not seek to upset their laws or means of governance.&quot;

[[&quot;Hmm, I see.  I want to ask about something else.&quot;-&gt;AskCon]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="333" name="AskBenny" tags="" position="3661,8564" size="100,100">The Nun nods, the thick septum ring piercing her nose shifting slightly.  &quot;Another ancient tradition.  Legal traditions in most Ringdoms hold that for one to be a Slave, there must be a Master.  Our Benefactor would be that Master, although few Sisters ever actually meet him.  He is a Lord in an Antipodal Ringdom, and rarely travels.  We Sisters actually operate the Order, and manage ourselves according to our own Hierarchy.&quot;

[[&quot;Every slave a master, it does make sense, I suppose.  I have other questions.&quot;-&gt;AskCon]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="334" name="AskMale" tags="" position="3716,8698" size="100,100">&quot;We do not,&quot; Euphoria explains matter-of-factly.  &quot;Unlike some religious sects, we are not so traditionalist that we reject the notion of male slavery as a *concept*, but the Order is open only to women.&quot;


[[&quot;Your overall beliefs, regarding masculinity then?.&quot;-&gt;AskMasc]]
[[&quot;Actually... let me think about it, I have other questions.&quot;-&gt;AskCon]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="335" name="AskMasc" tags="" position="3866,8698" size="100,100">&quot;The Order of the Primrose is of Torei, a necessity given our divine task.  Bliss is formed by its surrounding circumstances, after all, making its presence on each planet virtually unique.  Thus our views on gender are somewhat traditionalist, following Torean standards.  We are of the view that, as women, we are by nature subservient.  Beings of sensuality.  Requiring guidance and direction, the sort only a collar can provide.  We are at our best on our knees, submitting to the masculine.&quot;

[[&quot;And, do you have male members?&quot;-&gt;AskMale]]
[[&quot;The greater galaxy does not hold to those views, at ALL.&quot;-&gt;AskMasc2]]

The Vow of Femininity addresses the subject directly.&quot;

[[&quot;I have other questions.&quot;-&gt;AskCon]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="337" name="NunContem2" tags="" position="3805,8213" size="100,100">&quot;Then follow me.&quot;

Crossing the small clearing in which you had found her, the Sister leads you to where the strange trees ran up against the wall-- revealing a door obscured by a few wayward growths.  Pushing it aside, she uses one hand to open the door, her other gesturing for you to enter.

The door yawns deep and black, the subdued shadow of the garden descending into inky nothingness within.

[[You step into the midnight.-&gt;NunContem3]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="338" name="NunContem3" tags="" position="3938,8307" size="100,100">(if: $NunSens is true)[You have been within the Convent before, and know some of what comes next.

Your guidance through this world of darkness.](else:)[You stand in a rectangle of light, the last vestiges of the world outside dwindling.  Even those are wiped clean as Euphoria enters behind you, dragging shut the heavy door.  With its closure, you&#39;re plunged into a darkness more absolute then you had thought possible.  All encompassing.

&quot;This Convent is dedicated to Perception,&quot; the Sister explains, her hands falling on your shoulders.  Even whispering, her voice in your ear booms in the absolute silence.  &quot;To better approach that ideal, we strip ourselves of all competing distractions.  Perception is as much what you do *not* perceive as that which you do.&quot;

The hands on your shoulders tighten slightly.  &quot;Through my service, I have been made capable of guiding you,&quot; she intones, as you begin to walk.  The ground is some hard surface, but that&#39;s all you can tell.  &quot;Our space for Contemplation is not far.&quot;

If you were expecting your eyes to adjust, they do not.  There are no windows, no portals to the outside beyond the one you entered.  Just *darkness*, and the laminate-clad Sister behind you.  It&#39;s only then you recognize, with sudden distraction, how *she* saw.  Those eyes, so unnaturally red.  Implants or something less invasive, it did not matter-- her vision had clearly been altered for just such environments.]

[[Accept her guidance.-&gt;NunContem4]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="339" name="NunContem4" tags="" position="4038,8434" size="100,100">As promised, it&#39;s not long before you begin to hear other things.  The sharp report of heeled boots upon the floor first, followed by the occasional sound of doors closing, of quiet voices in discussion or repeating verses before they&#39;re sealed off again.  Were you entering into... smaller rooms, perhaps?  *Cells?*  

The Sister breaks you from your wonderings, your fears.  &quot;We approach your room.  Within it we will find a prayer frame, a device we use to ensure your body&#39;s posture follows your mind in total Contemplation.  You need only follow my instructs as we install you for the duration of this program.  Is that understood?&quot;

[[Shake your head yes.-&gt;NunContem5]]

Would that be a Sin?  You&#39;re not giving the chance to question such things as her word proves true, the hiss of a door opening being followed by an order to halt, then kneel.

The *prayer frame*, as the Sister had named it, you obviously cannot see.  But as you&#39;re positioned, then strapped in, you at least get the sense of a metal frame to which a series of cuffs and chains are attached.  You in turn are attached to *them*, forcing you into the prescribed position for Contemplation.

Kneeling, your head is forced down by the collar, eyes fixated on a floor you cannot see.  (if: $Level is &gt; 1)[Your armbinder is likewise locked into place in an uncomfortable, slightly raised position behind you.](else:)[Your hands are locked to seperate poles, then maneuvered closer, your palms connecting in a classic example of steeple-fingered prayer.]  Further down your knees are spread, the cuffed to the floor.  

It&#39;s an ingeniously simple setup, requiring only a few minutes to secure you, and then giving little in the way of movement afterward-- even straining you cannot shift from the posture of prayer now enforced upon you.


[[And then...?-&gt;NunContem6]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="341" name="NunContem6" tags="" position="4037,8733" size="100,100">Then Euphoria leaves, closing the door on the way out.   It locks with a harsh *click.*  She explains nothing, nor does she instruct you further.  Instead you are left to the dark, to the silence, to your enforced posture, and your own thoughts.  *Contemplation* at its most pure.

An independent prospector, a modern day treasure hunter living among the fringes of known space.  A pioneer, an explorer.

One of the undoubted millions locked into some bondage device on Torei, legs spread, eyes down.  The bondage, the humiliation, the laminate-- you&#39;ve submitted to it all, bit by bit.

Start from the beginning.  You remember the ride on the Space Elevator, the fabled Way Up... you were going *down*, right?  Or were you truly taking the *way up?*  Returning to the stars... or escaping to them for the first time?  The tenth?  You have no way to remember.  Perhaps this *isn&#39;t* your first week on the planet.  Others have commented on it, how easily you have taken the roles &quot;forced&quot; upon you.  Isn&#39;t everything easier with practice?

Now that would be something.  An alternate theory, at the very least.  Mem-Burn isn&#39;t the only means of changing one&#39;s memories on this planet, after all.  Much stronger options exist, the sort that blanked out *years*, leaving only those so very far back-- and those most recent, somewhat damaged.  Did you really check your room as thoroughly as you think you did?  If you *had* been planetside before, as a tourist, on another prospecting mission, or something else entirely-- that would make your ID a fake at the very least.  An assumed identity, a shadowy deal in motion.  Perhaps it *was* illegal.  Or dangerous.  Or both.

Perhaps it hadn&#39;t been you, but someone else.

&quot;But if it *had* been you?&quot;

Then the selfbondage must have been intended to keep you there, until the countdown had ended-- tomorrow, beyond the date of the deal, before your ticket on the Way Up expired.  A narrow window, with a singular purpose.  Had you tried to stop yourself from completing the Black Card&#39;s deal?

&quot;Something to contemplate further, I think.&quot;

Wait...

[[That wasn&#39;t you, that was a voice in the room...  Euphoria.  &quot;Hello?&quot;-&gt;NunD5]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="349" name="NunD5" tags="" position="4069,9500" size="100,100">&quot;Hello, dear.&quot;  

It *was* her.  Had she snuck back in?  *How much of what you had just said had been at her prompting?*

&quot;You do not need to worry,&quot; the Sister continues, her gloved hand finding your chin.  Her touch is soft, warm.  &quot;It happens to everyone, their first couple times.  Denied so much of what we normally perceive, our minds wander.  Play tricks on us.  Do you know what time it is?  You&#39;ve been in here for *hours*.&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; she admits readily.  &quot;We explored something you *needed* to contemplate, with a bit of guidance on my part.  A memory in such a state is liable to Sin.  You must be careful, whatever you choose to do going forward.&quot;

A final buckle frees you, and the Nun guides you upward, once again placing her hands on your shoulders for further direction through the fathomless black.  &quot;You have my full confidentiality, regardless.  What we speak of in Contemplation is not to be repeated.&quot;

You are either here for your first week, and merely... well attuned to Torei.  Or this is *not* your first time, and your dealings on this planet are less straightforward.  Then this note you hold, this Black Card?  Either you tried to keep yourself from following through on the deal, or someone else did and tried to hide that truth.&quot;

You can feel the heavy shackles on her wrists as she directs you around what must have been a corner.

&quot;What happened *then* may very well be determined by your *Perception* of the now.&quot;

She pulls somewhere to your right, and suddenly the darkness breaks-- light.

Euphoria does not ask more of you, but merely returns to her kneeling position at the center of the small clearing.  As her hands fold together, she speaks once more.

&quot;I hope you found Contemplation to be worthwhile.  The 50 credits will be in your account.&quot;

Even so, Euphoria keeps her voice low, whispering in your ear.  &quot;We have arrived at *Sensation*, as you no doubt can perceive.  You will find pleasure here, great deals of it.

They too were riding the high of their bondage, their prayer, their Sensations in *exactly* the same cycle as you&#39;re experiencing.

There are differences, of course, especially among those you hear brought it in after you.  Their gagged climaxes come quicker, rushing to screams of pleasure that take your now more well-worked cunt longer to reach.  But as time goes on, passing in whatever handfuls or leaps it was, everything seems to... sync up.  The purr of your devices, the strained moans you emit, the squirming orgasms.

Once more you are plunged into that eternal solitude, but this time when the Nun takes your shoulders, guiding you, she directs you further back into the Convent.  Far further then you had gone before.  Along the way you sense several other forms that flank you, exchanging whispered words with Euphoria.  Despite your proximity, you catch only the odd syllable.  Clearly they&#39;re quite experienced in the quiet of the Convent.

&quot;We are here,&quot; Euphoria finally prompts, raising her voice.  You glance around, but the darkness is the same as any other-- beyond your ability to perceive.  &quot;My Sisters will assist us in your assuming the proper position for prayer.

You&#39;re not given the opportunity to resist, not this far in.  Instead several sets of hands merely guide you forward, making good on their promise.  In short order the pole is placed, then risen-- pressing up between your legs.  When they add chains to cuffs at your ankles, enforcing a wide stance, you quickly find yourself unable to pull free of the pole.  You simply lack the slack to lift your torso off the device.  It&#39;s a prison of sorts, deviously simple.

And it feels *good*.  (if: $Slave is true)[By rolling your hips forward you can induce a stronger buzz against your front plug, but it&#39;s a hard position to hold, your corset interfering.

The light focuses, becoming less all-encompassing until you can at least determine it had a source-- the wall before you, previously black as anything else, had change.  It is now a rectangular portal, perhaps six meters wide by two meters tall.  And there are *things* moving past it.  People.

It is not a portal to some other world, but a *window*, having made transparent what had once been opaque.  A window looking out onto what could only be the street behind the Convent, much the same as the one you had entered from: an empty street but busy sidewalks, so many in glossy laminate.

The more you struggle, the more pole and vibrator collude to leave you panting, your muscles tensing as they seek release.  A vicious cycle.

To your sides, however, you do occasionally pick up the murmuring of those Sisters who flanked you.  They *did* have prayers, and being so intrinsically Torean they could even have applied to this situation.  But those are not available to you, not *yet*.

Afterward, the Sisters make no effort to release you.  Your bindings remain in place, the phallic intruder between your legs as well.  And the vibrator seems to only run faster.  Nature runs its course.  You cum again, then again.  And again, and again, and again...

By perhaps the first half dozen you couldn&#39;t have raised your head if your prayer frame had allowed you, but instead merely drool lewdly onto the floor, chest rising and falling rapidly as you inhale violently-- your body trying to regulate itself.  It *fails*.

Even further in, the window seems to dim.  The world outside loses its luster, growing darker.  The pleasure between your legs remains intense, inescapable, but exhausted muscles ache as well.  You&#39;re spent, and yet your Revelation pushes on.  Endlessly.  Perhaps you even hallucinate, towards the end.  Glancing up, somewhere deep into this waking hell, you see a demon passing outside.

But one does effectually step back into the darkness, shadows gliding across her uniform before she disappears.  One of those in white and black.  She reappears a few minutes later, carrying something as she approaches you.

Standing before you, the angle your prayer frame required allows you only to look at a downward angle-- meeting the tall woman&#39;s heavy corset with your gaze.  But it&#39;s her hands you focus upon anyway.  In one she has a small vial of some manner of clear solution, and in the other small cloth.  Applying the first to the latter, she reaches out-- and begins shining your laminate.

You vaguely recall guarantees that laminate retained its gloss and luster for weeks at a time, but the Sister before you doesn&#39;t appear to mind.  She works slowly, moving in small circles starting at the collar around your neck.  From there she shifts downward, to your shoulders, then your breasts.

One passing slave pauses and opens her mouth, the glass soundproof but her amusement clear.  The woman accompanying her, perhaps her owner, swats her quickly on the rear as they continue on.  Another woman makes some sort of hand signal towards you, her eyes empathetic.  Others merely ignore your humiliation, but that&#39;s almost worse, isn&#39;t it?  To be displayed so publically, and to *still* be unworthy of attention?

You&#39;re not waiting long before another employee of the transport hub emerges from a side door, towing behind her a woman of laminate and faith.

Sister Dahlia is much as you were led to expect, with a uniform bearing many similarities to Euphoria&#39;s.  The greatest difference is the color change, the reds of the older woman replaced on Dahlia by pure white.  Instead of a long cloak her habit is short, passing just behind her shoulders and exposing more readily the cuffs she bears on her wrists.  Similar devices are locked to her ankles, and yet another is pulled tight around her throat.  It&#39;s that last one a simple black laminate leash is connected to, and that you are give.

The Sister&#39;s muzzle makes it impossible to tell if she is gagged, at least until she demonstrates she was not-- but greeting you enthusiastically.

&quot;Oh!  You must be the escort the Convent arranged?  I&#39;m Sister Dahlia... but I suppose you already know that, huh?  Neat!  You&#39;re going to be taking me to the Convent, right?&quot;

It&#39;s a bit difficult to match the girl&#39;s outgoing personality with the stark religiousness of her uniform.

[[&quot;Yes, I&#39;m your escort to the Convent.&quot;-&gt;Dahlia2]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="418" name="Dahlia2" tags="" position="2259,10093" size="100,100">&quot;Great!&quot; The Sister responds, as you lead her away from the Slave Pen desk.  She follows readily, arms held before her due to the chain linking her wrists together.  

Once you&#39;ve gotten a bit of distance from anyone else, the Nun speaks again.

&quot;You uh... you paid the fine I had, right?&quot;

Curfew violation.  At least not on purpose.   I&#39;m just still getting used to it.  The Order, I mean, and what... uh, that means.

She rolls her shoulders, clearly still adapting to her uniform.  That heavy corset in particular doesn&#39;t look altogether comfortable.

&quot;...and because I don&#39;t want to be punished for it. You don&#39;t know what its like to spend hours and hours performing enforced prayer!  And that&#39;s *before* they make me perform flagellation, or put me in silence for however long they want!&quot;

She snaps her gloved fingers.  &quot;Supplication.&quot;

It&#39;s a command Dahlia obviously knows, as she moves to her knees, bowing her head as her legs spread.  Her linked wrists frame her chest as she plants her palms on the ground, and Euphoria proceeds to ignore her for the time being.

Sister Dahlia kneels much as Dahlia does, but is deeper in the shadows of the garden, and far less distinctive-- she is neither tall nor bearing strange red eyes.  Instead her brown pupils emerge as she looks up at you.

She reaches up, pulling down the laminate muzzle that encapsulated her chin and mouth.  For the first time her lips are revealed, full and inviting, painted a deep glossy black.  And across them, one white word upon each, carefully inscribed in the Torean script:

**Slave
Sinner**

&quot;I believe you capable of entering service within the Order.&quot;  She continues, as you fail to avoid the truth that her convictions are faulty, mortal, born from the mouth of a sinner and slave.  &quot;It would be a furthering of what I observed as you walked the paths of Contemplation, Sensation, and Revelation.  Regardless, I must recommend against this path.  To enter the Order is to forego much in this life.  Wealth.  Comfort.  Liberty.  You will be held to a standard of conduct far above most others, and your Sins carefully recorded.  You will be judged, and found wanting.  As we all are.  But thus is the path towards Bliss, and how we walk it.  Being corrected and trained, punished and denied, every step of the way.&quot;

Then she retreats, pulling her muzzle back up as she guides you towards the door to the Convent. (if: $NunEnd1 is true or $NunEnd2 is true)[Dahlia is summoned to trail along as well.]  Entering the black, she guides you as she had thrice previously.  As with Revelation you are directed back, deep into the heart of the abyss.

Red neon in the form of a triangle, the Order&#39;s symbol, frames a raised platform upon which you are directed to stand.  

Despite the light, gloom still prevails, revealing little more then the dark stone ceiling-- and figures moving above.  Only Euphoria remains at your side, occasionally watching the progress with eyes that *pierced* the black.

&quot;You will be entering service as a Novitiate, by Torean law a slave for three months.  At the end of that period you may renew your vows, or leave.  That is your choice.  If you renew four times, the fourth will be your Confirmation-- where you become a full member of our Order.  That is when the Vow of Uniformity is enforced upon you, and you are made to look exactly as I do.&quot;

Several other members of the Order have taken up positions surrounding you.  Their laminate glows red, reflecting the dim neon lights as Sister Euphoria continues.

&quot;You will take five vows.  Poverty.  Obedience.  Penance.  Femininity.  And Devotion.  Then you will be sanctified, shorn of your current outfit and remade anew in the Order&#39;s image.  The next time you leave this chamber, you will be enslaved.  Do you understand?&quot;

As promised, the small structure is already stocked with several stacks of pamphlets-- much like those Michael was giving out at his corner post-- alongside a few other broadsheets, each pulled forth from a stack labeled for their intent.  *In Debt?, We Can Help!, and What to do if Your Passport has been Seized* are some of the titles.

Everything goes smoothly, for once.  Your luck with promoting the Liberty Society goes about as well as Michael seemed to be fairing, in that few show interest-- but you are able to direct at least a handful of wandering folks towards the Society&#39;s hotline.

Between them a lucrative slave trade has formed, and the Prime Markets downtown are where the vast majority of this Ringdom&#39;s wealth is derived.&quot;

Her hands come together, wrist cuffs clicking quietly together.  &quot;And with slave markets, come runaways.  Fortunes can turn quite quickly, if purchased by the wrong Master.

Our Convent here is a place of pilgrimage, and on occasion we receive visitors by carriage.  I have come to learn from these interactions that the carriages are expensive, and thus do not ask many questions.

&quot;Early this morning we threw the Ministry of Truants off the trail by having someone use the train with Amadori&#39;s credentials.  Obviously the Officers found nothing when they searched it before leaving.  If you present the Officer who hired you with that ticket stub, it should convince them Amadori has fled further afield.&quot;

She looks up.  &quot;I must admit some confusion.  There are much simpler, cheaper ways to transport a mere crate.&quot;

And that makes it suspicious.  Two days from now would ensure the carriage itself wouldn&#39;t get caught in another checkpoint like you had originally been picked up in.  It&#39;s a solid lead.

Between sights so very unique to the planet itself, and the tendency for roads to wander confusingly, its easy to get lost.  But with some perseverance you manage to find the address the Transit employee had given you, on Quinnette Way.

The intended pickup spot for the &quot;crate&quot; turns out to be a simple warehouse, the building clearly kept up, but currently unoccupied.  At least that&#39;s what you guess after observing it for a few minutes.  The doors do not open, and no one can be seen entering or leaving.

The door is plastered with a warning sign, indicating trespassers would be reported to the Ministry of Truants.  It&#39;s hardly a threat to you given your purpose, and with a nudge of your shoulder the portal opens-- it had not been locked.

Inside reveals the warehouse to look... very much like you would expect a warehouse to look, stacked boxes and crates competing with heaping sacks for space along the floor and shelves.  Dingy lights cast down on the slatted floors you walk along, heels clicking loudly upon the hard surface.

It&#39;s not a particularly large warehouse, but searching it top to bottom would take all day.  Looking around, you try to pick out objects of interest.

Other papers note the arrival and departure times of various shipments, a glimpse into the small storage operation obviously occurring here.  Running through the list of upcoming departures, you cross reference it with the Transit employee&#39;s scheduled pickup time in two days... only to find the page missing.  The last entry instead notes the upcoming departure of &quot;pre-formed slave uniforms&quot;.

(if: $QuinnQ1 is true)[Having found what had turned out to be the missing pages, you again consult the upcoming schedule-- and find exactly what you are looking for.

Ellia Amadori, neatly packaged for delivery.

She&#39;s lying on her stomach, covered from head to toe in black laminate.  Several padded inserts cradle and support her bound form, although given the way her legs are folded back and behind, it hardly looks comfortable.  Her arms are locked together in a heavy armbinder, and she&#39;s gagged and hooded-- but the remote had already confirmed it could only be her.

An ingenious plan, really.  The Ministry of Truants was combing the streets and nearby hostels, looking for a slave on the run.  Instead she had been here the entire time, securely stored, incapable of endangering herself or those assisting her-- and ready to be moved as soon as the checkpoints and searches ceased.  It certainly doesn&#39;t look like an easy means of escape, but she *was* a slave.  This was a small price to pay for freedom down the line.

Her hood and position prevent her from seeing you, but by the way she squirms clearly she knew she had been discovered.  Amadori is at your mercy.

She grasps, as if intendeding the evidence to be placed into her hand.  It comes as a bit of a surprise when you do, giving her the ticket stub indicating the slave had escaped on a train this morning.

You do, from the lead that pushed you to visit the carriage station, through your search of the warehouse, and to that final crate that contained the fugitive slave.  She should still be there now, you report as well, giving both the address and the partcular stamp you had noted that marked Amadori&#39;s hiding place.  The Officer takes several notes on a small pad along the way, asking for your elaboration on a few minor points.  Somewhere along the way she actually starts smiling.

&quot;Well, she concludes.  &quot;I&#39;ll radio to my team, have them check this out.  If you want take a seat near by car, we will wait for confirmation.  Then I&#39;ll give you the reward, 400 credits and a train pass, as promised.&quot;

You can tell the point at which she determines its legitimacy by the grimace that overtakes her.

&quot;Dahom and Mazos,&quot; she curses, violently curling her hand around the stub into a fist and slamming it onto the hood of her crusier.  &quot;I *told* those fools they should have sweeped the lines this morning a second time.  Runaways are *clever.*&quot;

Her eyes close as the Officer takes a deep breath before turning back to you.  The mild disdain she had harbored for you only seems to have deepened.

&quot;Well, I promised you credits only if we brought the slave in.  Which means you failed, and you get a hint of a reward.  Only question is if you deserve to be punished.&quot;

You should at least go back down the road by the Officer, its less suspicious given most landmarks are that direction anyway.  And as far as you should be concerned?  This entire thing never happened.  You never met me, the Society doesn&#39;t touch runaways, and Michael is just giving out pamphlets.  Got it?&quot;

She moves to break from you, just as the round the corner back towards the officer.

It takes some time for the confirmation to come through, but when it does Nikaido slaps the hood of her vehicle loudly-- commending her people before returning the radio to its holster, and approaching you once again.

&quot;You were dead on,&quot; the Truant Officer declares, already holding out what you can ascertain is the promised train pass.  &quot;And the 400 credits will be in your account shortly, along with the train pass I promised.  The Ministry of Truants appreciates your cooperation in this investigation, and the rightful return of property to its proper owner.

Elizabeth hooded and cuffed, moments before carried off for arrest.

Nikaido turns on you, almost unable to contain her excitement.  Her hands clasp against your shoulders as she leans in.  &quot;That one just earned herself a collar.  How *wonderful*.  And you?  You earned yourself a bonus.  I&#39;m going to mark you down for a 75 credit bonus, atop that which we promised for Amadori.  You&#39;ve earned it, for turning in another freewomb like that.

Without eyes to see you are guided through dressing in pre-formed laminate, the cool material covering you in several adjoining layers.  Just what you bore is hard to determine, but some sensations do provide hints of intent-- stricture at your waist, indicating a corset.  Tall heels.  And heavy steel, one of the last additions that could only be cuffs, which fastened to your wrists and ankles.

Just *what* you had become is only revealed when the light finally returns, this time white and clear, from beneath your small stage.

You blink away the darkness as light washes over you, reflecting in slick waves across the laminate uniform you now bear.  Gone are your old vestments, dissolved back to their primordial laminate composite and replaced with something far less secular.  
(set: $Gear to 6)
A black catsuit provides the base layer, but so much more is layered atop it.  From the heavy corset, to the long gloves and stockings, to the coif and habit that crown your head-- you are a Sister of the Order now, like Euphoria(if: $NunEnd1 is true or $NunEnd2 is true)[, and perhaps more identically, in the image of Dahlia].

The other nuns kneel around your platform, but Euphoria remains at your side, her red eyes watching your reaction more then anything else.  She offers you a hand, alongside a command.

&quot;Rise, Sister.&quot;

[[You comply.-&gt;NunRevFinal14]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="528" name="NunRevFinal14" tags="" position="5132,9599" size="100,100">Standing proves to be an experience all its own, as you for the first time balance on your new heels-- much like those you had chosen from the wardrobe, but invested with... so much more, when collected together with so much else like this.  

&quot;You now bear the regalia of our Order,&quot; Euphoria continues.  &quot;You have been cuffed at ankle and wrist, so that you may at all times remember that you are a slave-- a woman in her natural place, enslaved and providing service for your superiors.  Those would be your Elder and Superior Sisters in the Order, as well as freewombs and any male you come across in your duties.&quot;

In her hands she holds one last circlet of steel, the metal carefully inscribed along the band while the front has a heavy metal look, to be used with leashes or any other sort of restraint.  A collar.  *Your* collar.

Euphoria holds it aloft.  &quot;Going forth, you will take a new name to match your new role within our order.  By tradition we utilize the names of flowers for our new members, and given that you were born an offworlder we have chosen a name for you to match that heritage-- being from beyond Torei.  Do you accept this collar, and your new name, Sister?&quot;

You feel her lift your habit, sliding the collar in until its pressed tightly against your throat.  It&#39;s cold, like the planet itself perhaps, but warms to your touch.  

And then it snaps closed, magnetic locks clicking shut.  Euphoria is joined by the rest of your new Sisters in reverence, their heads bowing as those with cloaks draw them back, exposing the colored panties pulled tight between their legs.

&quot;Welcome, Sister *Azalea.*&quot;

Further rules and expectations are given to you.  One of the Sisters takes your identification card, returning with a new one later.  You have taken a new name, Sister Azalea, and the ID reflects that.  Perhaps of more immediate concern however is what&#39;s stamped along the top.  Instead of the bright red word FREEWOMB, you now are labeled in pure black as a SLAVE.

Eventually Sister Euphoria clips a short leash to your new collar, and directs you with it.  Together you leave the circle of light so deep inside the Convent, returning to darkness for a time before being led once more to the light of the world outside.  The garden, and beyond that the wrought-iron gate.  

&quot;You&#39;re wondering where we are going,&quot; Euphoria notes, pausing momentarily to look at you.  Your uniforms may be similar, but she seems to fill it out so much more intensely, from the swell of her hips and bust, to her sheer height.  It&#39;s hard not to be intimidated.

You turn to find, to your surprise, a vehicle actually utilizing the normally quiet roads.  Although perhaps &#39;vehicle&#39; is a bit of a stretch, as you&#39;re confronted with a woman seated primly on a small, one person carriage.  Instead of horses or an engine of some sort, another woman is merely hitched to the front, the girl-made-pony providing the necessary locomotion.  For now she is stilled however, eyes down and breathing deeply.  Drool runs down from the bit gag between her teeth.

&quot;You (if: $Slave is true)[, Slave,](else:)[, girl,]&quot; the carriage&#39;s rider repeats, gesturing to you with the whip she holds in her hand.  &quot;I have need of you.&quot;

You have come across a small alcove, the architecture of the building above overhanging the sidewalk.  In that shadowed space you find a woman bound on her knees, a strict looking bar attached to her throat conspiring with the cuffs and chains at ankle and wrist that have immobilized her.  A ball seated behind her teeth prevents anything approaching speech, but as soon as you meet her gaze she clearly tries to gesture for you to approach.

&quot;You can ignore her,&quot; another woman, seated on a bench nearby, comments without looking up from the book she holds.  &quot;Poor thing is almost out of time anyway.&quot;

The woman is dressed in pure black, from the laminate leotard she wears with such an aggressive cut across her chest, to the long-sleeved bolero jacket upon her shoulders, to the knee high boots strapped to each leg.  A riding crop hangs from her hip as well, as if she needed anything more to so clearly occupy the role of dominatrix.  And yet, she is collared.

Turning the corner, you break into the clear along an elevated stretch of road.  It allows you a rare view out over the neighborhood, and beyond that a great swirling storm pouring slowly into the city.  A silent tempest, perhaps only a few minutes away.

&quot;Beautiful isn&#39;t it?&quot;  A muffled voice to your side comments.  (if: $Slave is true)[&quot;Good thing you&#39;re masked.  Does your owner know you&#39;re out like this, though?&quot;](else:)[&quot;You better get your mask on, though.&quot;]

The line blocking your path turns out to be... something one would only find on Torean streets-- a collection of women, all wearing laminate office attire(if: $Sec is true)[ much like your own], chained together by the collars around their throats and the cuffs linking their hands before them.  A slave coffle.  You appear to have caught them just before entering what could only be their place of employment, the neon sign out front identifying it as *Conrad and Company Technical Support.*

Passing them is easy enough, but you cannot help but marvel at the size of the line compared to that of the company-- Torei&#39;s strange demographics apparently ensured any number of slaves could be used in lieu of more modern means of accomplishing something.

Did that make them more efficent, or less?  You&#39;ve seen how cheap slaves come here.

Approaching closer, you find what could only be the Mistress standing with leash in hand-- rummaging in her purse.  At her feet, a girl in brown laminate crawls.  She&#39;s covered from head to toe, with the mask in particular lacking any mouth-- but sporting a pair of ears that emerge from the top of her head.

A catgirl.

But those strangers are each their own world, separate, mere fellow travelers.  What you feel is *different*.  Something is watching you, perhaps even following.  Maybe you have even felt it all day, being so suddenly in the grips of paranoia distorts everything.

She marches into the nearby store, leaving you in the street with the violet-laminated ponygirl.  Checking the carriage allows you to easily find a bottle of water and small hand brush, the later more a buffer then anything bristled.  

The ponygirl finally meets your eyes as you approach her, shuffling hesitantly in her harness and restraints.  The collar she wears clearly identifies her as a slave, as if the armbinder and gag did not already.  Of those, the gag in particularly seems a difficult thing to bear, the metal pulled deep into her mouth, an integrated tongue suppressor preventing anything approaching speech.

She marches into the nearby store, leaving you in the street with the violet-laminated ponygirl. 

The ponygirl finally meets your eyes as you approach her, shuffling hesitantly in her harness and restraints.  The collar she wears clearly identifies her as a slave, as if the armbinder and gag did not already.  Of those, the gag in particularly seems a difficult thing to bear, the metal pulled deep into her mouth, an integrated tongue suppressor preventing anything approaching speech.

She takes to the bottle as soon as you raise it, greedily gulping the water that pours past her gag.  Being hand-fed so blatantly in the street doesn&#39;t seem to bother her a bit, although you get a sense any resistance had been broken during her earlier work-- the rider had been pushing her hard.  In the parlance of such things, she is truly well lathered.

[[Brushing, next.-&gt;PonygirlFull3]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="547" name="PonygirlFull3" tags="Debt" position="6327,7968" size="100,100">Without bristles, the brush more accurately shines the glossy violet laminate of the ponygirl, but you work quickly through the effort nevertheless.  It&#39;s attention she clearly enjoys at the very least, turning into your hand where ever her bondage allows.  Laminate remained slick and reflective for days at a time, making much of the effort little more then small touch-ups-- but the girl&#39;s rider clearly cared about maintaining proper presentation if she preferred this means of travel.

By the time you&#39;re wrapping up only a few minutes of passed, but the rider is quite prompt-- she emerges with a small bag in hand, coming up alongside you to examine the work.  The ponygirl shifts between skittish concern and apparent excitement when her owner seizes her reins.  A sharp command provides some manner of unspoken command, causing the girl to take several prancing steps forward.  It seems to please the rider, as she climbs up into the seat afterward.

&quot;Everything appears to be in order,&quot; she notes, then flips a 50 credit clip into your waiting hands.  You&#39;re spared no more of her attention as the rider picks up her whip, hanging it briefly off the side of the carriage before wielding it in a sudden flash of intense motion.  The tip cracks in response, moments before striking the ponygirl between her legs, wrapping up against her cunt with a sudden snap.

It&#39;s another unspoken command, as the ponygirl jolts into motion, high-stepping down the street.  The carriage and rider are pulled along, and soon they turn the corner out of sight.

It only takes a moment to puzzle out what her response meant: the fact she hadn&#39;t spoken it aloud makes it obvious enough.  The gag doesn&#39;t really allow her to answer such questions.  Perhaps you should try something simpler.

Despite being bound, displayed so publically, and worked so hard she was still enjoying the experience.  It&#39;s something to consider, at least.  Torei has so *many* opportunities.

You get the sense she would have happily elaborated on the subject, had the gag not been firmly between her teeth, and if her rider had not returned at just that moment.  Like some manner of demon, or perhaps guardian angel, it seemed merely mentioning her summoned the woman.

She carries a small bag, but checks her slave before depositing it upon the seat of the small carriage.  When she moves up to your side, she carries a small credit chip, which she surrenders.
(set: $debt to it + 50)
&quot;50 credits,&quot; she notes.  &quot;Did she give you any trouble?&quot;

The girl tips her head back slightly in response, allowing her owner to press a bottle to her lips, giving her a long drink of water.

It seems your suggestion to push her harder had been taken up.

The seated woman pauses her book, looking to you for a moment.  &quot;Offworlder,&quot; she notes, licking a finger before turning a page and pulling her gaze back down.

&quot;Think of what you see before you as a beggar,&quot; she explains.  &quot;Usually that means simply being without credits, but this... this is worse.  The poor thing is in *debt.*  (if: $Level is &gt; 0)[Judging by your gear, you know the feeling.]  How does a freewomb escape such debt?  Collateral bonds.  Accept a cuff, or two, or four... some chains... and find someone to pay them off.  Usually with one&#39;s body, in the traditional manner.&quot;

Again she flips to a new page.  &quot;But this one is too far gone, I&#39;m afraid.  Locked in place, gagged-- a girl at least needs a hole to earn a *few* credits.&quot;

The one on the bench closes her book, however, looking to you with pointed interest.  &quot;I didn&#39;t think you would be the charitable type.  But yes, that would be completely within your means-- and a good thing too.  Soon her time would run out, after all, and with bankruptcy would come enslavement.  The only way to pay off her debts at that point.  If our little fool is liable to work her way out of this predicament, I would think it would assist her most if you paid to unlock the cuffs or gag.  I believe they have 50 credits of debt associated, each.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll pay for the ankle cuffs.  For a standard agreement?  An hour, your hands, whatever I want.&quot;

It doesn&#39;t take long to pass-- a few minutes at most.  You emerge to find the last lingering hints to be snow-like flakes of dust drifting slowing down from the sky, the storm itself visible in the distance, retreating as quickly as it had arrived.

As others return to the streets, you try to remember where you were heading in the first place.

Clearly the catgirl had heard your conversation, she already had approached you.  Kneeling down, you reach out, running your hand between her faux ears.  Her laminate is smooth and slick to the touch.  Without a mouth to speak, the creature instead purrs, approaching you closer.  You notice she&#39;s corseted, and that her hands are little more then padded mitts, rendered utterly useless and stamped with feline designs.  Behind, a tail flicks from her rear.

You follow it.

Past an overturned dumpster, deeper into shadow.  The buildings here are *old*, and you notice for the first time the alleyway below is cobbled with smooth expanses of stone.  Had this been a proper road once?  Old storefronts seem to loom out of the darkness, black eyes looking out for passersby that no longer visited.  

And it&#39;s to one in particular the signal seems to pull you, despite whatever reservations you held.  To a plate glass window, the mask of a building otherwise abandoned.  Peering into that window, you see little more then gloom and falling water-- a pipe within perhaps, burst and leaking.  As you stare, the signal seems to fade, a slight headache emerging in place of the simulated one.  Your concerns and paranoia suddenly seem so *silly*.  No one had followed you into the alleyway, and looking back down it you see no one occupying it now.  You&#39;re alone, as you turn back to the window...

A silhouette.  Had the water not been falling upon its head and shoulders, you may not have even noticed it at all.

Male, but only vaguely so.  Black laminate seems to cover it from head to toe, cloaking a face without eyes to see, or a mouth to speak.  Yet you can all but *feel* it staring at you, regardless.  It *knows* you, and you know it.

Daemon.  Emmissary.  The word matters not.  For that briefest of moments, you&#39;re face to face with a far greater whole, a mortal form cloaked by divinity.  Native Toreans often called them *Gods*, not this isolated sould entombed in laminate before you, but the thing pulling its strings-- thousands of kilometers away, entombed in ice at either pole.  The AI builders of this world, its silent shepherds:  Mazos and Dahom.

What made you worthy of consideration by such beings?  The figure doesn&#39;t tell, but steps back instead, disappearing into the gloom as suddenly as it had appeared.  In its wake, you&#39;re left only with that lingering headache as the sounds of the city reassert themselves.

Dusk threatens as you approach the Transport Hub, Sister Euphoria leading you by the leash.  But your attention is on the surrounding crowds-- many eyes turn towards you, even as they give space for your passing.  The uniform of the Order clearly proved distinctive enough, its presence rarely far from your mind.  Your heavy corset makes every breath a new experience, while your habit keeps shifting into your line of sight.  Reaching up to push it back you catch sight of your wrist cuffs, the similar set affixed to your ankles clinking quietly with every step.

You&#39;re focusing on the tight laminate across your chest when you are brought to a sudden stop by the red figure before you, Euphoria having pulled up before a security checkpoint.  Somewhere along the way you had missed the beginning of her conversation with the transit attendant, but you catch the end.

&quot;...the standard, yes.  Full restraint.&quot;

Just what *that* meant is left briefly to your imagination, as Euphoria pulls you forward again, following the attendant who hefts a briefcase from behind her desk.

[[Full restraint?-&gt;NunLead2]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="624" name="LeaveLead" tags="" position="8701,11733" size="100,100">&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/7Lkt4v0.jpg&quot; width=&quot;30%&quot; height=&quot;30%&quot;&gt;

The Lead platform is little more then a concrete patch beneath a suspended wire line, from which descend a length of steel cable every few feet.  As you watch, those freewombs or slaves capable of hooking their collars to the cables do so-- those too heavily bound(if: $Level is &gt; 1)[ such as yourself] are assisted in the effort by attendants.  A few of the waiting chains seem to have empty collars affixed to them as well(if: $Smoke is true or $Sec is true or $Brand is true)[, for outfits such as your own].  After a few moments, the Lead moves of its own accord, &#39;escorting&#39; its charge forward-- down a sloping ramp and back into the city proper along a raised corridor that disappears between the distant buildings.  

This will cost you 200 credits.

Your carriage is pulled by a quartet of women in full tack and harness, large feathers affixed to their head harness at a jaunty angle.  They&#39;re mostly nude as well, excepting hooved laminate boots that rise to their knees, and heavy armbinders that pin their arms behind them.  Blindered, only one manages a glance at you, but she&#39;s clearly more focused on her work as she drools lewdly from the bit gag slotted between her teeth.

The carriage itself is sumptuous, a small enclosed cabin being opened by a transit attendant.  She helps you up the pair of steps and waits until you sit down before closing the door.  The seats are a dark burgundy laminate inset with recessed buttons that give a very archaic, very old fashioned sort of look.

A driver had been seated up front, and its she that prompts the ponygirls into action with a crack of her whip.  Leaning your head out the window, you can see them high-stepping as they lean into their harnesses, drawing you and the carriage forward.  A slight slope brings you back down to the Torean streets, along which you clatter.

Every step by the enslaved quartet draws you closer to downtown.

[[Let&#39;s get to it!-&gt;Startup]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="636" name="Lead Walk" tags="" position="8600,12055" size="100,100">Your destination looms ahead, dark buildings lit by brilliant lights, but the distance to them is quite substantial indeed.  It&#39;s little wonder the Lead system seemed reserved for slaves, and those freewombs incapable of paying for better transport-- somewhere past the first hour mark of your forced march you&#39;re starting to regret going with this particular route.  You&#39;ve been on your feet most of the day after all, and given your outfit that meant doing so in sharp stilleto heels.  Your toes ache and your ankles burn(if: $Brand is true)[, the ballet heels you wear making the effort absolutely grueling].  (if: $Level is &gt; 0)[The hobble chain between your ankles doesn&#39;t help matters either, the restricted gain requiring nearly double the amount of steps you would have naturally taken.]  (if: $Level is &gt; 1)[For once its your armbinder that hardly proves troublesome, your aching arms having gone from acute discomfort to a dull ache somewhere during your actions in town.]

(if: $Slave is true)[Compared to most of the other women utilizing the Lead, however, you do have a distinct disadvantage-- between your legs the dual plugs installed inside your cunt and rear remain, and each step forward shifts them.  The Slave suit kept you wet pretty much regardless, but this particular experience only furthers the effect.  Climax never comes however, the ministrations more then enough to tease you relentlessly, but not enough to cum.]

At least you have plenty to look at as you march.  The Lead winds its way through the buildings of the outlying district, usually upon a platform raised above street level.  It almost seemed as if you were on display: leashed and dressed in glossy laminate, paraded past the rare individual still on the streets post-curfew.  More are visible within the windowed rooms that look out to the Lead, other offworlders given the perfect opportunity to gaze out upon your sort-- locked into a high tech slave coffle.

[[Your march continues.-&gt;Lead Walk2]]

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="637" name="Train Ride" tags="" position="8900,12047" size="100,100">Diving down beneath the cityscape, the train reemerges on the far side, apparently running at ground level for the distance between the city center and the outskirts you had just left.  The ride itself takes only fifteen minutes, but you cover a considerable distance.  Had you taken the Lead, you imagine you may have been walking for *hours.*  With your heels, clearly a considerable discomfort had just been avoided.  And in that warm feeling of choices well made, you consider the next one before you: the Club and the Way Up.

The Black Card had given an address, 356 Cross Street, and a time-- dusk.  Both rapidly approached.  Despite all your misadventures along the way, you could still make it.  The deal of a lifetime with a party unknown could still go down.  *If* that was what you still wanted.

A safer option presented itself, of course.  The ticket you held for the Way Up.  It expired at midnight tonight, and to chase the Black Card&#39;s promise would be to risk missing your ride.  And that was ignoring your battered memory, the mystery that still held sway there.  Could you have erased your own recollection of recent events, and tied yourself to that bed, in some attempt to prevent a meeting with that Black Card?  Why?

Either way, a decision would have to be made soon.  Glancing out the window again, you are greeted with another transit hub, much like the one you left in that it had been built on a raised platform.  But this one is towered over by the buildings around it, and on approach you can already see the platform is much busier then the outskirts.

The carriage was not particularly fast, but the quartet of harnessed girls providing your transport draw eyes which soon fall upon *you.*  You had witnessed how rare vehicles tended to be, after all.  It&#39;s not hard to consider the curiosity that filled those you passed, wondering who had the wealth to travel in style.  It&#39;s a tantalizing prospect, but one you eventually push aside.

Instead of immediately continuing however, Isabella takes a moment to pull her electronic cigarette from her purse.  The tip glows a familiar red as she gets it going, allowing you a moment&#39;s rest.

[[Ensure your posture is perfect, stick our chest out just a bit further.-&gt;SlaveTChest]]

The Lead platform is little more then a concrete patch beneath a suspended wire line, from which descend a length of steel cable every few feet.  As you watch, those freewombs or slaves capable of hooking their collars to the cables do so-- those too heavily bound are assisted in the effort by attendants.  After a few moments, the Lead moves of its own accord, &#39;escorting&#39; its charge forward-- along a raised corridor that disappears between the distant buildings. 

The attendent brings you to a segregated loading position, red marks on the floor spelling out FULL RESTRAINT.  Unhooking your leash, Euphoria returns it to her belt as she leans in.

&quot;As I said, we will be taking the Lead into town, Sister Azalea.  We are slaves, after all, and are not allowed other options.  It is traditional within our convent that we do so utilizing Aekora&#39;s full restraint package, to which you will be fitted shortly.  I would recommend you take the opportunity for self-reflection this trip will provide.  Now pull down your muzzle, and open your mouth.&quot;

[[&quot;Do we need... whatever this is, though?&quot;-&gt;NunLead3No]]
[[&quot;Yes, Sister.&quot;-&gt;NunLeadYes]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="641" name="NunLead3No" tags="" position="9433,12029" size="100,100">Euphoria&#39;s red eyes loom out from beneath the shadow of her habit, catching you in their stern gaze.  &quot;You are new to the Order, and I will remember that-- this time.  But know that if you speak out of turn again, I will perform corrective action upon you.  Women are best seen, not heard, and are we Sisters not that femininity exemplified?&quot;

She doesn&#39;t give you an opportunity to protest, but instead makes her demand again.  &quot;Pull your muzzle down, and open your mouth.&quot;

You&#39;re in too deep now to truly resist.

[[&quot;Yes, Sister.&quot;-&gt;NunLeadYes]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="642" name="NunLeadYes" tags="" position="9583,12030" size="100,100">Reaching up, your gloved hands momentarily shift the ring piercing your septum as you seize the laminate muzzle below it.  Pulling the thin material down reveals your lips, and while you cannot bear witness yourself, you have seen already upon Euphoria what had been done there-- a paired set of words are carefully written, one one each lip in bright white.  **Sinner.  Slave.**  You cannot speak to another without their being so reminded.

But you&#39;re not asked to speak here.  Instead Sister Euphoria provides you with a black rubber ball, seating it behind your teeth before securing the strap behind your head.  The gag is then covered by your muzzle again, a slight bump the only hint that you had been denied speech.

Then its the attendant&#39;s turn, opening her briefcase to reveal the implements of *full restraint.*  Your arms are positioned behind your back then linked together with a small clip that utilizes your cuffs.  A chain is then run up, forcing your hands up in a terribly unnatural way, until it can be connected to the waiting d-ring at the back of your collar.  The result is a position of reverse prayer, an aching pain already rising in your forearms.  Your ankles are given a similar, if less restrictive treatment, the cuffs there being linked together with a short bit of chain.  You could still walk, if only barely.

&quot;Ah, a familiar experience,&quot; Euphoria muses quietly, watching as the final implement is affixed to you: a blindfold of black laminate, returning you to a darkness much like that of the Convent.  

[[&quot;What now?&quot;-&gt;NunLead3]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="643" name="NunLead3" tags="" position="9583,12180" size="100,100">&quot;Mmmmgh.&quot;  It&#39;s all you can manage, the ball gag very much doing its work.  Your moan seems to have drawn Euphoria however, who gently runs her hand along your habit as if it were hair.  Her tone is soothing.  &quot;Hush.  You need only focus on your walking.  Without eyes to see, and hobbled as you are it will be difficult.&quot;

The sound of further metallic rustling announces the Lead&#39;s chain running to the system above being snapped to your collar, just before you feel its weight.  Euphoria&#39;s doing, provided with a final bit of advice.

&quot;Let your leash guide you, and remember: I&#39;ll be right behind you.&quot;

That explains the wait that follows, the sounds of Euphoria being similarly restrained drifting back to you.  Eventually the attendent inquires if anything further was required, to which the Elder Sister responds with a gagged moan of her own.  That would be a no, presumably.

You don&#39;t have to wait much longer before the Lead kicks suddenly into motion, pulling you forward.  Stepping, your hobble chain almost immediately goes taut.  The Lead hardly cares, requiring a great deal of effort as you struggle to take your next step.  Blindfolded, it takes you a longer moment to notice the curving of your leash, the Lead moving to join into a singular track, merging with its fellows as it entered the city proper.

Already you&#39;re panting.

[[It&#39;s going to be a long walk.-&gt;NunLead4]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="644" name="NunLead4" tags="" position="9583,12330" size="100,100">It&#39;s little wonder the Lead system seemed reserved for slaves, and those freewombs incapable of paying for better transport-- somewhere past the first hour mark of your forced march you&#39;re feeling the effects of your fresh uniform.  You&#39;ve been on your feet most of the day after all, and given your outfits thus far that meant doing so in sharp stilleto heels.  Your toes ache and your ankles burn, joining the sharp pain that comes from your strictly pinned arms.  Meanwhile the gag between your lips and the muzzle atop it effectively deny breathing through through the mouth, requiring your pierced nose to perform the heavy labor all the while fighting the strict embrace of your corset to pull in oxygen.

You cannot help but struggle somewhat, moaning lewdly into your gag as you shift your shoulders.  All that does is wiggle your breasts, the piercings embedded in each nipple making themselves known as the soft flesh shifts.  Had you more control over yourself perhaps you would have considered the way the raised walkway seemed designed to put you on display, the Lead being little more then a high tech slave coffle, your humiliation and submission so clearly demonstrated for any passerby.

The last rays of sunlight glide along the horizon, running down your body in a glossy reflection amongst the laminate, as the city builds up around you.  You&#39;re not far now, and that turns your thoughts to the choice ahead.

The Black Card had given an address, 356 Cross Street, and a time-- dusk.  Both rapidly approached.  Despite all your misadventures along the way, you could still make it.  The deal of a lifetime with a party unknown could still go down.  *If* that was what you still wanted.

Could you have erased your own recollection of recent events, and tied yourself to that bed, in some attempt to prevent a meeting with that Black Card?  Why?

Either way, a decision would have to be made soon.  The ache in your legs is rewarded by the sight of another transit hub, much like the one you left in that it had been built on a raised platform.

Grand Aekora rises all around you, buildings thrusting towards the heavens, shealthed in gleaming glass.  Neon lights burn out into the encroaching darkness from a hundred different sources, sendings waves of reflected light across the hundreds of figures you see moving in the distance-- the vast majority undoubtedly women much like yourself, clothed in so much laminate.  Further back, those coming or going along the transport lines making their way, but the balcony is a space of serenity between both masses.

With your eyes down you are presented only with your own image, a creature of black laminate kneeling before her Mistress.  You fight the urge to shift your hips, or to make any attempt at shifting the pair of plugs buried deep within your womanhood and rear.  Walking from Isabella&#39;s bench to the train had slickened your cunt, muscles sucking greedily on the laminate phallus.  

That Isabella had noticed your self reflection is noted with her heeled boot intervening, sliding between your kneeling legs.  &quot;Wider,&quot; she commands, tapping the inside of your thigh with a toe.  &quot;A good slave knows when to spread her legs.&quot;

At least two others like yourself are visible, one of them fully geared in a standard slave suit.  Even at this distance, you make out a slight humming sound... which perhaps explained the occasional slight twitch from her hips that you notice.

Isabella seizes your attention again by her heeled boot intervening, sliding between your kneeling legs.  &quot;Wider,&quot; she commands, tapping the inside of your thigh with a toe.  &quot;A good slave knows when to spread her legs.&quot;

As the cinnamon scent of her cigarette descends, so does her hand, stroking your head much like one would pet a dog.

&quot;You&#39;re a natural at this,&quot; she muses, pausing as she withdraws her leg.  Only then does she reach down, a hand beneath your chin drawing your gaze upward, meeting hers.

Only then does she release you, a simple corrective action completed.

&quot;I appreciate the... enthusiasm, but I expect my slaves to do as I command them to.  The alternative is a round of punishment.&quot;

Her nonchalance never breaks, despite the obvious threat.  Instead she takes another draw from her cigarette, the sweet scent of cinnamon descending alongside her hand.  It finds purhase beneath your chin, raising it up so that she can meet your gaze.

That&#39;s a fact that Isabella makes clear by requesting your ticket for the Way Up, still valid until the end of the day.  Holding it up to the light briefly, she then proceeds to rip it in half.

&quot;No longer valid,&quot; she explains, setting the pieces down.  &quot;Offworlder or no, slaves are not allowed anywhere near the Way Up.  Were you to somehow show up there, the Ministry of Truants would detain you, and I would be notified to come pick up my property.  And I would punish you *severely*, of course.&quot;

You had left the city&#39;s outskirts to a setting sun, but now dusk has firmly descended as you are greeted by another transit attendant.  Glancing around, you recognize a transport platform much like that which you had departed from-- but this one is much larger, with towering buildings rising up on all sides.

Behind you Sister Euphoria is being unbound in the same manner you are, removing the leash leading to the Lead, then the hobble, followed by the arm restraints.  The last is the ball gag between your lips, which the Elder Sister removes herself-- looming tall above you as she leans in.

Squinting in the distance, you can even see a dim light streaking downward from the sky-- the elevator bringing new arrivals to the surface.  It&#39;s still a bit away, but from your vantage you can make out a dedicated transit line running directly there.  Given the number of tourists using it, the credit requirements and restrictions you witnessed elsewhere are even waved.  

The other option, of course, comes in the form of the Black Card.  Holding it up to the light, you can still make out the address imprinted upon it.  The mystery remained, as well as the potential reward: the deal of a lifetime.  Riches untold.  As long as it didn&#39;t take *too* long, so you can still make the elevator.

It proves poorly timed however, as another set of arms slip a medical-like set of braces momentarily between your lips.  You thrash, a natural instict, but they don&#39;t proceed further-- instead a padded ring follows in its wake, being seated behind your front teeth.  The braces then pull back, slipping out through the center of the ring, extruding straps that eventually snap into the black laminate of the bondage hood you still wear.

Your saliva follows, clinging to the obsidian phallus before dripping onto your chest.  She reinserts it immediately afterward, smiling again as your brows upturn, struggling to take its length.

&quot;I only thought it proper we fill all *three* of your holes,&quot; she notes with amusement.

She doesn&#39;t need, nor does she look for an answer.  Instead your cinnamon-scented Mistress merely takes up your leash again, tugging on it to force your following along.  &quot;Come then.  I need to stop and send a message to my other slaves, and then we will make for that address on the Black Card.  A club of some sort, if I recall correctly.&quot;

You focus on breathing only through your nose as you follow along.

It&#39;s a severe enough predicament to ignite a slight burn between your legs, your slickened cunt growing all the wetter as you try to further the sensation.

The screen displays a pair of models wearing the selected outfit.  To call it *intense* would be a severe understatement, as the warning that follows makes clear:

*This is a standardized Slave-Rated Wardrobe outfit, as described in the Aekoran Slave Codes, Chapter 812, subsection 10.  Wearing this uniform will subject all Slaves to High Protocol Laws as described in the Aekoran Slave Code, Chapter 679.  Freewombs wearing this uniform will be subjected to portions of the Slave Code, and certain liberties may be revoked.*

Accessories are listed as the pictured corset, heels, regulation mask, posture collar, and (non-pictured) inserts.  The corset is noted as featuring &#39;real steel&#39; boning, and is custom-measured to match standard Torean expectations of functional corsetry.  So too does the posture collar proudly proclaim its core as beein &#39;real steel&#39;, as well as meeting all Aekoran slave law requirements.  The heels are listed as six inches in height, with one inch platforms.  The mask is simply described as rated for Torean storms, as well as regulating oxygen intake.  And the inserts?  Those are described as front and rear installation, custom-molded for maximum stimulation.  All devices feature 10 hour self-release locks.

On one hand it would a terribly strict crash course in Torean culture for Corinth, but on the other... (if: $Slave is true)[you wear the exact same outfit, with all the discomfort-- and pleasure-- that came along with it.]

&quot;It didn&#39;t even give me *panties*.  And these heels.  I feel like I&#39;m on display for everyone watching.&quot;  Reaching up, she pushes her hair out of her eyes, centering herself. It takes a bit, but she manages it. 

&quot;Alright, well-- no going back.  I&#39;m pretty sure that machine like... dissolved my real clothes.  So... how about we get back to why I was looking for you in the first place?&quot;

At first Corinth tries to pull away, but quickly she submits-- overwhelmed by so much laminate and raw sexuality.  It&#39;s a pose you hold, reveling in the sensation until you finally break-- pulling away with her sweet taste upon your lips.

A officer of the Ministry of Truants holds the baton, her laminate uniform gleaming in the terminal&#39;s overhead lights.  

&quot;Move along, whores,&quot; she instructs, using the baton to push you away from the Wardrobe machines.  &quot;This ain&#39;t a spot for loitering, not  unless you&#39;re using the slave hitches.&quot;
(set: $CorWow to true)
She gestures towards one of the surrounding indents built into the walls, where a number of collared women (and one male) kneel, each leashed to post emerging from the concrete.  Perhaps surprisingly, however, the Officer then moves along-- already honing in on a woman arguing with a slavegirl store attendant further down.

It&#39;s the break needed for Corinth to pull away, catching her breath.  Still, she smiles slight, clearly fighting the urge to slip a hand beneath her skirt and finish what you started.

She blushes fiercly in response, but holds your gaze.  Despite the public venue, few pay much attention to you-- sensuality often overflowed on Torei.

&quot;I...&quot;  It&#39;s all Corinth manages, breathing quickly.

At least this planet is so remote that no will recognize me... not that they could with this mask, I guess...&quot;

Reaching up, she tries to push her hair out of her eyes, an old habit. Instead she finds only smooth laminate.  She sighs, looking down once more before continuing.  (if: $Slave is true)[You just know she&#39;s trying not to touch her own cunt, given how wet your own cunt is.]

And yet somewhere beneath all that black laminate some sense of dignity reemerges, Corinth pushing you off, taking a step backward.

Afterward you emerge not out onto the street (a good thing given curfew), but into one of many connecting corridors between the various buildings that made up downtown.  Pointing out the shuttle system that moved from various points in the city to the Way Up, Corinth waves goodbye.

&quot;I&#39;m going to head to the elevator, wait until the ride comes tonight.  With... everything that has happened, I hope you&#39;ll join me.  Be careful.&quot;

A security checkpoint awaits at the terminal exit, however, and it is there that you run into trouble.  Upon reaching the uniform Truant Officer manning your particular line, she needs only one look at (if: $Slave is true)[your and] Corinth&#39;s uniform to pull you from the line.

&quot;Hey,&quot; Corinth complains, stumbling in her new heels.  &quot;I--&quot;

She&#39;s answered wit a stun paddle being snapped against her rear, and the Officer&#39;s sharp interruption.  &quot;You&#39;ve been randomly selected for an extra inspection, as a slave.(if: $Slave is true)[ Both of you sluts.]  Up against the wall, hands against it, legs spread, rear up and presented.&quot;

Corinth seems liable to complain further, but the Officer preempts her with a gesture of the stun paddle.  The wall in question is between the entrance and exit doors, out of the way but very much visible to everyone coming and going.

But it does have a Customs Enclave, a small area rented to the Ringdom, which you could reach by a short land shuttle ride.  That would be Corinth&#39;s destination, and thus eventually your own, but indecision still grips you.

Do you truly intend to give up on your mysterious deal?  That *was* your entire reason for coming to Torei in the first place, you&#39;ve pieced together that much at least from your shattered memories.  You still possess only a comparable handful of credits, and almost anything could happen during your attempt to reach the Way Up.  Perhaps you would need the credits or... whatever it is your deal entails.  Certainly there would be a customs checkpoint(if: $Slave is true)[ and you doubt they would allow one such as yourself in a slave uniform to walk freely through].

But on the other hand, deep in your mind, there is that simple feral flight response, burning in your chest and throat.  The need to *flee*, damn the consequences.  You can feel it now, pushing you hard, whispering you should not only go for the Space Elevator but that you should run, not walk, in pursuit of that goal.

Even so, with your growing experience you find it quite easy to pick out the offworlders from those Torean-born or trained.  You end up trying to avoid them, their gawking slowing the passage of those around them almost as much as their stumbling steps-- few seem well-versed in heels.

Your impatience is fueled by a growing sense of Dusk drifting rapidly into night proper, and the Black Card&#39;s demand that you make it before the latter.  Still, you reckon you will make it with time to spare.

After a moment however your experience shines through, and you notice her legs are hardly *spread*.  They&#39;re apart, certainly, but with so many onlookers passing by she&#39;s keeping them relatively close together.

&quot;I&#39;m... going to head out, and... try not to... you know, before my elevator ride arrives.  Despite... everything that just happened, I still hope you&#39;re there when it comes.&quot;

She&#39;s searched thoroughly, the Officer spending plently of time with her hands between her legs, gliding along the smooth black laminate.  In fact she keeps a hand teasing there as she searches elsewhere, then proceeds to question the girl.  By the time she&#39;s finally released Corinth is all but begging to cum, a reward the Officer flatly refuses.

Instead she is sent your way with a final slap of the electrifed pattle against her rear, a wink being shared between you and the Truant Officer.  For her part, Corinth seems subdued, not even meeting your gaze as she makes for the door.

She catches on quickly, even if she looks down in shame as she mimics your submissive posture.

All around the crowds continue to move, those queued for the exit check especially well positioned to watch your shared molestation.  Despite the lines the Truant Officer hardly seems to be in a hurry, her examination continuing languidly before she speaks again.

&quot;I want you bent over now,&quot; she commands.  &quot;At the waist, although with those corsets you don&#39;t have any other option. Hands on your ankles.  Eyes on the floor, legs still spread.  I want a good view of your plugged cunts.&quot;

Since being installed inside your slave suit your cunt has been wet from the presence of the plugs, and now such direct stimulation drives you towards ecstasy.  The walls of your womanhood *ache* for release, the pressure building as the Officer performs her work.  After a few minutes, with Corinth already squirming, the Officer leans in.

&quot;Getting there, aren&#39;t we?  If you want to cum, I want you to turn around, get on your knees, put your hands behind your back-- and tell me you&#39;re a wet slut who wants to cum.  Got that?&quot;

In short order your mouth is returned to a permanent &#39;O&#39;, your red lips as inviting as they are submissive.

Corinth notices just as she finishes, the magnetic base snapping to the ring with a click.  Your shameless seeking of attention is met with a mighty blush from the girl, who retreats as quickly as she could.

&quot;The Club your Black Card provided the address for is our next stop,&quot; she explains, emerging out into a covered thoroughfare.

A gloved hand from Euphoria indicates your escort, a man leaning against the supporting pole of the awning above.  He’s tall, somewhere over six feet, with the broad shoulders and clear musculature of his gender—so rare on Torei.  The full laminate suit he wears only emphasizes that point, the slick glossy material pulled tight across body and face, the later forming a heavy looking gasmask.

“Master Petros owns an estate in the hinterland,” Euphoria says, hands clasped together before her in prayer as much as explanation.  “His family has been one of the leading suppliers of raw laminate to Aekora for decades now.  We of the Order have enjoyed that familial patronage for nearly as long, and his personally for much the same.”

She turns her gaze from the man, back to you.  As always, its hard to hold against the intensity her red pupils could exude.  “It is important to note that Master Petros is a traditionalist and holds women to *very* strict standards.  Slaves such as us even more so.  I would suggest you follow my lead in his presence and remain supremely deferential towards the Master at all times.”

[[&quot;You&#39;re welcome.&quot;-&gt;Nun Hub]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="802" name="ClubTravel2" tags="" position="7700,15713" size="100,100">Moving through corriders, you&#39;re not greeted with a grand vista of your destination from afar, but instead almost run face-first into an impressive display of neon.  Your address, your destination, is labeled with bold letters: **(colour: &quot;#e619e5&quot;)[CLUB LUSH]**.

The doorway is ornate, curling columns framing each side, seemingly rendered in glass or some other manner of transparent material.  Nearby lights enter them only to refract, spilling out in bright patterns.  It&#39;s enough to distract you momentarily from a choice that presents itself-- but eventually you focus on your immediate concerns.

Not only is the club ornate, it&#39;s guarded by a bouncer, a testament to the Club&#39;s wealth demonstrated by the fact that he&#39;s male.  To the side a short line awaits, and even a quick glance makes it obvious the clientele trends towards the elite.  The only slaves you see are attending a Mistress or Master.  Getting in that way could be pricey.

The alternative is a sign near the corner of the building, a neon arrow pointing around it and somewhere near the back.  *Entrance By Merit* is all that&#39;s given as an explanation.

[[Try the front door.-&gt;ClubFront]]

The wait takes only moments, the bouncer quickly waving through the handful of patrons before you.  When it comes to your turn, however, he holds up a hand-- while looking you up and down.

(if: $Blue is true)[&quot;Looking to get locked into something fun for the night?&quot; He asks, indicating the various cuffs and hardpoints scattered about your blue catsuit.  &quot;You would probably have better luck around back.  Best for slaves and submissives like you.&quot;

He shrugs.  &quot;Otherwise, cover charge for freewombs is 100 credits.&quot;](if: $Brand is true)[&quot;I&#39;m sure you&#39;re eager to get off those heels, but I can&#39;t let you through dressed like that,&quot; he explains.  &quot;Girls like you, wearing advert gear like that, I mean.

As you turn to go he slaps your ass, laughing as you yelp.

&quot;Watching you go with that corset and heels, though?  I&#39;m almost tempted to break the rules.&quot;](if: $Slave is true)[&quot;Don&#39;t you think for one second you&#39;re getting in this way, Slave.&quot;  He jerks a hand over his shoulder.  &quot;You need to go the back, see if you can earn a way in that way.

Given the peculiar layout of this portion of the city, with hallway-like interiors encircling each block, it seems possible that any little bit of extra space had been rented out.

Nevertheless you do eventually round a corner to find the club&#39;s secondary entrance-- and a line stretching far into the distance.

Stepping through the portal, you&#39;re greeted with a cacophony of sound and color.  Loud, pounding music thrums through your body as much as the air, matched with the flash of strobes and other lights.  Most of the coloration trends towards violet, adding to the otherwise dim atmosphere-- while reflecting brilliantly off the multitudes in attendance.  

Laminate in a thousand different forms glisten before your eyes, each more elaborate or revealing then the last.  The Club is a hive of activity, all of Torei seemingly condensed into this one place: Mistresses and Masters  attended by slaves, tourists gawking at every passing sight, and spread liberally throughout freewombs and other such independents.  Some are seated at the small tables near the center of the room, awash in the glow of neon, while others crowd the stage up front.  Along the edges booths allow for a more intimate audience, shadows hiding most of what went on there beyond the occasional flash of laminate.

Turning about slowly, you momentarily lose yourself in the madness of sensuality that perhaps best personified Torei.  (if: $Ballet is true)[Your ballet heels put you on as much display as anyone else, the posture required to walk in them pushing your chest out and emphasizing your rear.](if: $Wet is true)[  The bands across your thighs announce you to be part of the festivities, the colors seeming to glow in the violet light, highlighting the white of the words emblazoned there.](if: $Plugs is true)[  Your plugs once again purr to life, as if on cue, inducing a gasp-- and a struggle to prevent your hand from coming down between your legs.]

As if to remind you of your place in it all, Lush gives one last look at your current condition via the mirrors flanking the door.

[[Gaze long into the abyss...-&gt;MeetCherishColors]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="807" name="ClubBack2" tags="" position="7786,16009" size="100,100">Clearly, *Lush* was a popular-- perhaps *the* popular nightclub in Grand Aekora.  You pass all sorts of Toreans on your way to the back of the line, from spritely offworlders wide-eyed and staring at every passing woman (such as yourself), to Torean-born freewombs with slaves held by their leash, and every imaginable sort in between.  What is *missing* however, are men, at least those that clearly did not look like tourists.  Given Torei&#39;s proclivities, it&#39;s not unreasonable to assume they were allowed immediate access via the front.

Luckily the wait is not as long as you initially feared.  Instead of processing each potential entrant at the door, several women in black laminate move along the line, pulling out hopefuls seemingly at random-- although you note they skip anyone wearing non-laminate, and focus instead on the glossy, gleaming, and beautiful.  

It&#39;s not long before one of them taps you on the shoulder.

&quot;Purpose?&quot;  The bouncer looks at you expectantly, a *glass* device held in her hands.  When it becomes clear you don&#39;t know what she means, she checks a box on her glass.  &quot;First time, huh?  I&#39;ll give you the quick intro: you can wait in this line all night if you like, but we like to keep the party going inside, if you know what I mean.  If you can prove you&#39;re worth it, we skip you to the front.  So: what&#39;s your purpose?&quot;

&quot;Leg up, one at a time.&quot;

Sliding them into place proves easy at first, but grows progressively harder-- by the time she seats them properly upon your upper thigh they&#39;re quite tight.  &quot;There we go!  Follow me.&quot;

She leads you out of the line and towards the front door as you look down, staring at the laminate bands now encircling each thigh.  They&#39;re red, the lettering as bold as it is white-- **FUCK** on one, **TOY** on the other.  It&#39;s hard not to blush just thinking about wearing them in public, and harder still when you notice several of those in the line you&#39;re passing staring at the additions to your wardrobe.

Afterward she leads you out of the line and towards the front door as you try to adapt to the strict footwear.  Even standing still requires a demonstration of balance, while walking leaves you wobbly and teetering.

Almost like a baton, one side glows with a violet light edging towards white.

&quot;We need to change your suit adverts,&quot; she explains.  &quot;As I mentioned.  Lush has a reputation for maintaining a certain sort of class.  If you&#39;re going to advertise anything, it&#39;s going to be *our* services.  This device here is a mobile laminate printer, enough for our purposes.  I&#39;ll just need you to spread your legs, and hold your arms out to the sides.&quot;

As if expecting resistance to the idea, she tilts her head to the door.  &quot;Then you get to go inside.&quot;

Still standing in line, you try to bite down on the moan that rises to your lips, but its a losing effort.  It feels so *good*, even when emanating from the device up your ass.  So good, in fact, a wave of disappointment rises when they suddenly cease working.

&quot;I see you like it,&quot; the attendent muses, with a knowing look.  &quot;Their activation is semi-randomized, and intended to tease.  Most girls don&#39;t get an orgasm out of it... but you *will* be nice and wet.  Now come on, let&#39;s head up to the front.  You earned it.&quot;

&quot;Sorry about that,&quot; the attendant says, noticing your discomfort.  &quot;Probably should have mentioned that.  Wardrobe technology is damn near perfect, but once it gets this small some sacrifices towards the experience are made.  I promise it won&#39;t hurt *too* bad.&quot;

It&#39;s more of an annoyance then proper pain, she&#39;s right about that.  At least it goes quickly, the device being passed over each branded portion of your catsuit.  Thighs, arms, chest, back-- by the end the suit itself remains the same, but the designs imprinted upon it have changed.

And *designs* are perhaps the best descriptor.  Instead of words, most of the alterations are variations on the same swirling logo, the same painted on the door before you.  Only on your back and flanks are the words CLUB LUSH emblazoned boldly, the color a light purple to contrast sharply against the otherwise black hue of your suit.

&quot;See?&quot;  The attendant asks, snapping the handheld device back together.  &quot;Easy, right?&quot;

The bouncer opens the door as she waves you towards it.

&quot;**Breathtaking**, right?&quot;

It&#39;s only then, the words spoken over your shoulder, that you notice a woman had stepped up behind you.  Turning to regard her, you see that she is uniformed-- in tight laminate.  Surrounded by the violet hues of the club, her servant&#39;s livery matches nicely in it&#39;s light shade of blue, being tight across her chest before expanding to a very short skirt.  Just how short it is she demonstrates by lifting it for you while bowing.  (if: $PlayE is true)[You recognize it from your time with Isabella as a very well practiced Torean reverence.](else:)[A Torean curtsy, of some sort, you reckon.]

&quot;I saw you observing yourself in the mirror,&quot; she explains, smoothing out her skirt and petticoats, &quot;and I just had to say it, Mistress.  You wear laminate well.  Ah, but where are my manners?  Allow me to welcome you to Club Lush, my name is Cherish.  As a slave of this establishment, please allow me to service you in whatever manner you deem me capable of.&quot;

Her collar is thin, pulled tight against her throat, fashionable-- and without an observable way for it to be removed.

[[&quot;Services?&quot;-&gt;CherishServices]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="824" name="CherishServices" tags="" position="7130,16951" size="100,100">&quot;First time at Lush?&quot;  She winks.  &quot;No problem, Mistress.  Let me run you through the various services we offer here, alright?&quot;

She steps more directly to your side, allowing her white gloved hand to be more easily followed as she uses it to direct your gaze.  &quot;Most of our guests start at the bar, which is fully stocked with a range of drinks-- both alcoholic and otherwise-- sourced from all over Torei, as well as a selection imported from the Offworlders.  Or if you like, you may take a seat at a table or booth.  Built into each is a button you can use to call the nearest available slave at your convenience, as well as to reward or punish us as you deem necessary.&quot;

Just what *that* meant isn&#39;t clear, as Cherish turns you towards the mouth of a hallway that disappears into darkness-- a bright pink neon sign above shaped like a pillow.  &quot;We also provide several private rooms, outfitted with lounging areas and bed, rented by the hour.  Many freewombs utilize them to solicit their betters, but for the right price you can also rent me-- or any of the other slaves in-uniform for the night, if you like.&quot;  Another wink.  &quot;Restraints included, of course.&quot;

Finally she casts her attention upward, to the second story balcony overlooking the stage.  &quot;And that would be our VIP area.  Invitations are *quite* hard for most to come by, but if you do acquire one you need only speak with Charon at the elevator.&quot;

She seems to mean the obsidian-skinned male standing with crossed arms before the door.

[[&quot;Actually, I think I&#39;m supposed to meet someone here.&quot;-&gt;Cherish3]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="825" name="Cherish3" tags="" position="7130,17100" size="100,100">&quot;Ah, of course!  If you would provide your identification card, I can check to see where your party is waiting?  I just need to stop at the bar, I will be right back.&quot;

Taking your card, Cherish moves just as indicated, allowing you to watch her go.  Her swaying hips shift her skirt just *so*, revealing the triple hints of white that are her panties, petticoats, and garters.  At her return, however, you sense an incoming problem.

&quot;Mistress,&quot; she begins, &quot;the good news is that we did have your name on record.  Your party is waiting in our VIP Suite #4... but they did not provide authorization for you to ascend, and have an outstanding do-not-disturb order.&quot;

[[&quot;So I can&#39;t just go up?&quot;-&gt;Cherish4]]
[[&quot;What does that mean?&quot;-&gt;Cherish4]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="826" name="Cherish4" tags="" position="7130,17249" size="100,100">&quot;My apologies, Mistress, but we cannot allow a freewomb access to our VIP area without you being cleared by an existing VIP member, and as I said your party asked to not be disturbed.  You could always wait to see if they emerge or rescind that order, however?&quot;

You have no idea how long that could take, and the Black Card had been quite clear: *dusk*.  You don&#39;t have that sort of time.  Perhaps your expression (if: $Slave is true)[despite your mask] gives that away, as Cherish speaks up again.

&quot;Alternatively...&quot; she adjusts her glasses, Torean biomedical prowess meaning they *had* to just be for decoration.  &quot;...you could perhaps seek authorization from one of our VIP members still down here, in the common area?&quot;

She first indicates a woman seated primly at one of the private booths.  Alone, she would have been obscured by the shadows there were it not for the bright holographic image displayed before her-- although you&#39;re too far away to make out what it depicted.  &quot;Mistress Tysus Sargon, of House Sargon.  She is a scholar, as I understand it, but more importantly to your purposes a member of House Sargon-- one of the two ruling families of Aekora, and a VIP member.  Or...&quot;

Cherish shifts your attention to a man at the bar, a rounded gas mask obscuring his features.  &quot;Master Petros.  I am not certain if that is his first name, or last... he is *quite* mysterious.  But he is a VIP member as well.&quot;

[[&quot;Only the two options?  Does no one else go upstairs?&quot;-&gt;Cherish5]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="827" name="Cherish5" tags="" position="7130,17401" size="100,100">Cherish blinks.  &quot;Well no, no one else-- excepting uniformed slaves like myself, Mistress.  We of course serve the VIP lounge just as readily as we do those on the floor down here.  But that&#39;s not an option for you, of course.&quot;

*Or is it?  Glancing around, you notice occasional traffic in women dressed like Cherish from a side door near the stage.  Sneaking in there would be the most dangerous option, of course, but perhaps a back path led upstairs-- or at the very least you could find a Wardrobe machine that could produce you a uniform like those the Club&#39;s slaves wore.  Then you could simply pass right by that imposing looking bouncer...*

[[Hmm...-&gt;Cherish6]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="828" name="Cherish6" tags="" position="7131,17552" size="100,100">Lost in momentary thought, you&#39;re startled out of it by a sudden jolt of movement from Cherish.  Her cheeks flushed, the slave shifts her attention to look around at the tables nearby.

&quot;My apologies Mistress, but someone nearby just summoned me.  I will need to service them, but I&#39;m sure you need some time to consider your options?&quot;  She indicates the nearest table, one of the taller ones beneath the bright lights of the Club proper.  At it&#39;s center is a small control console, with several prominent buttons.  &quot;If you need me again, please do not hesitate to utilize the call function every table has.  Oh-- and a tab has been opened for you, if you run out of credits.  Obviously, consider the unfortunate circumstances that can come with being a freewomb in debt, though.&quot;

Again she lifts her skirt and bows, a farewell that she holds for a full step as she backs away-- and then makes her way towards one of the private booths along the wall.

You move to the table Cherish had pointed out, leaning an elbow on the high top as you consider your options.

He&#39;s both male and uncollared, a bit of a surprise given your knowledge thus far of Torean culture-- service industries seemed reserved for slaves, and they were almost always women.

As you make your way towards him, however, a hand reaches out to grab your arm.  (if: $DrinkB is true)[It&#39;s the woman you had met at the bar, Kell.

&quot;Be careful with that one,&quot; she warns.  &quot;Very... strict, with freewombs.  I wouldn&#39;t approach him unless you&#39;re really ready for it.  Petros doesn&#39;t give second chances, and he expects absolute submission from women.&quot;

Here the tables thin out until ending altogether in a short expanse before a door very clearly labeled **LUSH STAFF ONLY**.

The serving girl Cherish&#39;s mention of uniformed slaves like her being allowed free access to the VIP area had inspired you to approach, and you had indeed seen several of the powder-blue clad women make their way past the imposing bouncer at the VIP stairs.  But attempting something like that would be at the very least quite frowned upon by the Club&#39;s staff if you were caught, and knowing Torei&#39;s laws regarding your gender would probably be blatantly illegal.  Yet your conviction remains strong: you *must* find a way to reach that VIP suite, to make that deal that brought you to Torei in the first place.

Either way, making an attempt would likely be committing fully to this plan and abandoning other potential opportunities.

Even from afar the man appears massive, a fact confirmed with every step that draws you closer to him.  Undoubtedly somewhere far over six feet tall, his skin is a distinctive ebony, his outfit a stylish laminate evening coat with the sleeves rolled up to reveal heavy muscled arms underneath.

Nevertheless his tone is soft as he holds out a hand, at your approach.  &quot;VIPs only, love.  And while I don&#39;t mean to offend, I can usually tell who fits that bill.&quot;

*Classic 8-Point Catsuit, Metallic Blue: from one of Torei&#39;s most popular laminate design firms, this classic ensemble is often used as the base upon which more restrictive devices are affixed.*]

(if: $Gear is 2)[&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/WEdo76r.jpg&quot; width=&quot;30%&quot; height=&quot;30%&quot;&gt;
*Classic Smoke Grey Catsuit and Harness: another popular design from the Torean design houses, this outfit is notable for its use of semi-transparent laminate.  While the wearer&#39;s cunt is hidden by the opaque banded formed by the zipper, most everything else is on full display.  The harness and additional thigh bands provide easy restraint access.*]

(if: $Gear is 3)[&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/mEoSzB3.jpg&quot; width=&quot;30%&quot; height=&quot;30%&quot;&gt;
*Sexretarial Delight Uniform: perhaps the single most commonly used baseline laminate schematic, the classic sexretarial uniform is standard dress code for many businesses across Torei.  *]

(if: $Gear is 4)[&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/vaDhUa4.jpg&quot; width=&quot;30%&quot; height=&quot;30%&quot;&gt;
*Branded Advert Ballet Catsuit: a Torean staple, Advert outfits provide small amounts of credits (and complimentary outfits) for those willing to wear whatever is printed upon them.  Your current design is sponsored by Danise Incorporated, a small scale trading firm.  The inclusion of corset and ballet boots indicate a sponsor seeking its &quot;freelance models&quot; always maintain a proper posture.*]

(if: $Gear is 5)[&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/7hkuAc4.jpg&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; height=&quot;50%&quot;&gt;
*Standardized Slave-Rated Enclosure Suit: a common sight on Aekoran streets, the Standardized Slave Suit is a fully enclosing uniform that ensures personal chastity, posture, and humility.  Internal inserts are locked inside by the lower zipper, while the breath regulating mask above provides subtle endurance training.  Freewombs wearing this particular uniform are required to submit to certain Slave Code regulations until suit removal.*]

(if: $Gear is 6)[&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/2UPfyWF.jpg&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; height=&quot;50%&quot;&gt;
*Novice Regalia of the Primrose: exclusively worn by Sisters of the Order, this restrictive outfit was designed to both remind the wearer of their vows and allow for their easy restraint.  Freewombs and men are encouraged to personally examine any Sister&#39;s femininity at their leisure.*]

(if: $Gear is 7)[&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/2UPfyWF.jpg&quot; width=&quot;30%&quot; height=&quot;30%&quot;&gt;

(if: $Gear is 8)[&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/hjBAqe9.jpg&quot; width=&quot;40%&quot; height=&quot;40%&quot;&gt;
*Club Lush Standard Uniform: the uniform worn by the slaves that work as serving girls at Club Lush, it is specifically designed to be flirty.  A short skirt ensures the wearer&#39;s panties are display at the barest shifting of the hips, and tall platforms draw attention to the stockings and garters, to which a belt provides support for the latter.  The upper bands of the stockings and a small logo above the left breast bear the Club&#39;s logo, and the included glasses are synced to the service/reward/punishment system utilized by the Club.*]
(if: $Gear is 9)[&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/hbs73qN.jpg&quot; width=&quot;30%&quot; height=&quot;30%&quot;&gt;
Truant Prisoner Uniform: *designed for long term wear and confinement, this uniform is the standard utilized in most Ministry of Truants detainment facilities across Torei.  Consisting of a base black catsuit and blaze orange leotard straitjacket, the latter both provides easy restraint of the prisoner and marks them clearly as part of the penal system.  Black lettering on the back reads: TRUANT as well as their registered Truancy number.  An integrated collar is fitted with quick-snap hardpoints for the fitting of catchpoles, allowing prisoners to be restrained and moved at a distance by Officers.*]
(if: $Gear is 10)[&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/BQIuA91.jpg&quot; width=&quot;30%&quot; height=&quot;30%&quot;&gt;
Isolation Laminate: *worn exclusively by Daemons in service to the polar AIs, these all inclusive and restrictive uniforms are the pinnacle of Torean laminate technology and design.  Little is known about their inner workings, but wearers are believed to be fully integrated with suit systems, providing full control, access, and manipulation by the AIs and their delegated runtimes.  Often torturous stimulation or punishment are believed to be constant.  (colour: purple)[You love how it makes you obey.]*]
(if: $Gear is 11)[&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/rPZKbdc.jpg&quot;width=&quot;50%&quot; height=&quot;50%&quot;&gt;

Slave Overseer Outfit #343: *one of the outfits approved by your owner, its strong lines and sharp profile suggest power-- but the integrated collar and risque cut underline your dual positions as Governess to your sub-sisters and dutiful slave to your Master.*]
(if: $Gear is 14)[&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/eI7PaaO.jpg&quot; width=&quot;35%&quot; height=&quot;35%&quot;&gt;
Classic Soubrette Household Livery: *one of a myriad of outfits designed to conform to the classical Torean household position of soubrette.  Flirty and utilitarian, the short skirt provides ample opportunity for mischief, but the corset ensures posture, and the included apron protects against spills.*]
(if: $Gear is 15)[&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ZNyYZli.jpg&quot; width=&quot;35%&quot; height=&quot;35%&quot;&gt;
Courtesan&#39;s Evening Dress: *semi-transparent on the flanks, this richly designed dress is intended to be alluring-- and is frequently used by freewombs seeking a good collar, or slaves already serving in the position to which they are best suited.  Breast cups provide additional lifting and support.  Panties are not recommended.*]
(if: $Gear is 16)[&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/88uSNNU.jpg&quot; width=&quot;35%&quot; height=&quot;35%&quot;&gt;
High Protocol Courier Uniform: *as outlined in the Torean Slave Codes, subsection 213, this uniform is intended for courier-slaves operating in a full protocol position.  A heavy mask and breathing apparatus provide immunity to dust storms, and the integrated virtual administrator directs the slave on its routes and provides encouragement.  The backpack is also sealed, preventing unauthorized access and protecting the documents or parcels within.*]
(if: $Gear is 17)[&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ernFwOQ.png&quot; width=&quot;35%&quot; height=&quot;35%&quot;&gt;
Heavy Restraint Lifestyle Kitten Uniform: *designed for slaves performing in the classical catgirl household position, this particular design is intended for constant wear and heavy bondage.  Consisting primarily of the black catsuit, white piping provides an appeasing offset of color.  Included restraints include collar with bell, paw bondage mitts, and leg bindings.  The tail is mounted to a large buttplug, and the laminate mask includes magnetic mounts for blindfold or gag usage.  Not recommended for inexperienced slaves.*]
(if: $Gear is 18)[&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/G0lGB6M.png&quot; width=&quot;55%&quot; height=&quot;55%&quot;&gt;
Diarch&#39;s Choice Slave Uniform: *the standard uniform designed for use by Diarch&#39;s Choice brand hotel staff, slaves should be improved with platinum blonde hair and violet cosmetics to meet established aesthetics.  The main blouse is semi-transparent, while accessories such as the included pumps and pencil skirt are glossy black.*]

Naomi Couture Spring Collection Bespoke Wedding Dress: *unlike most Torean outfits, this one was hand formed and built instead of being manufactured by a Wardrobe Device.  Consisting of an open neck dress with flowered embellishments, the corset is particularly restrictive and features elaborate filigree.  A full set of undergarments are included, panties, stockings, and garter belt.*]
(if: $Gear is 21)[&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/FPh6mhf.png&quot; width=&quot;35%&quot; height=&quot;35%&quot;&gt;
Ceremonial Torean Guard Armor: *designed for long term wear beyond normal Torean environments and resources, this fully enclosed uniform features integrated front and rear plugs.  Inside the helmet the wearer is fitted with a secondary close-fitting layer of laminate, to which a full head harness and gag are generally affixed.*]
(if: $Gear is 22)[&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/wZm7GMo.jpg&quot; width=&quot;30%&quot; height=&quot;30%&quot;&gt;
Ministry of Truants Ponygirl Tack and Harness: *intended for experienced ponygirls serving in heavy restraint, this uniform features a full sequence harness and armbinder.  An integrated bit gag allows for easy guidance, while blinders prevent the pony from being startled.  The boots are particularly advanced, the hooved and shod gravity heel design built around height risers and a full amplification kit.*]
(if: $Gear is 23)[&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/A6LtL86.jpg&quot; width=&quot;35%&quot; height=&quot;35%&quot;&gt;
The Red Dress: *selected by Corinth for your use tonight, this lengthy evening dress features thin-lam stockings, opera length gloves, and a design intended to keep your legs fully exposed.  Beneath the dress itself a rather intensive set of lingerie is included...*]
(if: $Gear is 24)[&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/l6MJckM.jpg&quot; width=&quot;30%&quot; height=&quot;30%&quot;&gt;
An Offworlder Ensemble: *a common (and rather cheap) offworlder design consisting of a simple blouse, pants, and flat shoes.  The textiles are synthetic, a bit rough, and perhaps mildly uncomfortable.*]
(if: $Gear is 25)[&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/S2bG5Ap.png&quot; width=&quot;30%&quot; height=&quot;30%&quot;&gt;
Counterfeit Doll Outfit: *intended to mimic the usual designs and patterns utilized by Celeste Academy, this particular example is rather poorly made.  Its seams are heavier than any proper Doll would be comfortable with, and you doubt it will hold together for very long.  Nevertheless it is quite restrictive, and uncomfortable.*]
(if: $Gear is 26)[&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/qS3FRyD.jpg&quot; width=&quot;30%&quot; height=&quot;30%&quot;&gt;
Ministry of Truants Detainee Uniform: *Torean law can be quite specific when it comes to uniforms required of certain segments of the population, and this example is no exception.  Intended for those being detained for a significant time without specific charges, this outfit consists of a transparent laminate catsuit atop which a white leotard with integrated straitjacket is placed.  Included maglocks upon the mask provide easy mounting of blindfolds and gags, which are recommended by Ministry regulations.*]

Isabella&#39;s Adjusted Slave Uniform: *tweaked by your new Mistress, Isabella has removed your mask but retained most everything else, while also including a set of more aggressive accessories.*]
(if: $Gear is 28)[&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/tuXenSD.png&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; height=&quot;50%&quot;&gt;
Punishment Doll Uniform: *a variant of the Standardized Slave Suit, this advanced model is intended to operate with a full suite of accessories capable of greatly intensifying the experience and stricture.  Additional mag-locks on the mask&#39;s chin provide for dual gag use, while heavy duty zippers for vaginal and rear access prevent even the most willful slave from escaping.  Recommended for particularly willful slaves, or conversely, the most obedient.  Formed primarily from the standard black slave suit, additional provided accessories include a white-piped dress with open chest and particularly short skirt length, and six high stiletto boots.*]
(if: $Gear is 29)[&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/etxbCVw.jpg&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; height=&quot;50%&quot;&gt;
*Standardized Slave-Rated Suit, w/o Gasmask: a common sight on Aekoran streets, the Standardized Slave Suit is a fully enclosing uniform that ensures personal chastity, posture, and humility.  Internal inserts are locked inside by the lower zipper, although you have been permitted to be without the usual breath regulating mask.  Freewombs wearing this particular uniform are required to submit to certain Slave Code regulations until suit removal.*]

The smile comes eventually however, two fingers held out to indicate the shot glass.

&quot;But it is a gift from our friends at the poles.  One must wonder what they use the stuff for, hmm?&quot;

He nudges the glass, expectantly.

[[Drink it.-&gt;BarDaemonDrink]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="849" name="BarDaemonDrink2" tags="" position="6037,18624" size="100,100">Whatever you had intended comes out as a wanton moan, the surprise of it shocking you-- although the bartender at your side seems to have anticipated it.  

&quot;I wouldn&#39;t recommend walking for a few minutes,&quot; he advises, the reason why becoming apparent as the Daemon&#39;s Blood makes itself felt.  Your every nerve seems to momentarily spike, goosebumps emerging across your skin, before the sensation pulls back-- only remaining strong at certain erogenous points.  Your lips, your breasts, the space between your legs.  It&#39;s like small fires had been lit there, burning with a sudden, fierce desire.

You cross your legs, laminated thighs rubbing together.  (if: $Wet is true)[The bright words on your thigh bands suddenly announce a very clear truth, your cunt wet and hungry.]  (if: $Ballet is true)[As the bartender had warned, walking does suddenly seem out of reach-- merely standing in your ballet heels proves nearly impossible, your thighs rubbing greedily together as best they can.]  (if: $Plugs is true)[Worst of all, you can feel your womanhood aching, the plugs installed between your legs having already worked you into a sensual heat.  The urge to run your hand down, to masturbate as best you could, is nearly impossible to ignore.]

At your side, the woman named Kell looks to you.  Her lidded eyes are still ringed in violet, her lips pulled into a languid smile.

&quot;Your eyes...&quot;

The reflection of the bar reveals your own pupils circled in violet.

At your side, however, Kell leans in.  You crack an eye, only to see what she is doing, but you cannot help but notice the way her cerulean catsuit gleams wonderfully, pulled tight across her chest and waist.  

&quot;It&#39;s not nearly as fun if you resist it...&quot;

Turning to Kell, who seems to brighten, recognizing your intent, you embrace.  Glossy laminate glides across your arms and legs as you entwine, breast-to breast.  Looking into her eyes, the Daemon&#39;s Blood in her eyes, you hardly notice several onlookers nearby watching.

When you finally do manage something approaching self control, you open your eyes, revealing Kell to be absent and the bartender reaching over to take your shot glass back.

We&#39;re close enough to the Way Up, and the tram that runs directly there from here, to be easily reached by tourists-- but far enough away for them to get a proper taste of Torean culture.  Yet we&#39;re popular with the Torean-born as well, including the local nobility.  Both Naram-Sin and Sargon are frequent visitors.&quot;

He certainly does a good job of selling the establishment&#39;s features.

[[&quot;Very interesting.&quot;-&gt;BarQ]]

Hmm... I suppose I can say that I do enjoy bartending, even if I do not get to do so regularly.  Obligations being what they are.&quot;

Our Ringdom is ruled by a Diarchy, one each from the Sargons and Naram-Sin.  But that one is a scholar, not a politican.  Quite sharp, or so I&#39;ve heard.  Although her area of study is known for being particularly difficult.&quot;

He leans in over the table, the light emanating from the bar itself momentarily casting his eyes in shadow.  &quot;Daemons.  Emissaries from the ancient AIs at the poles.  Makes me wonder just what she&#39;s doing *here*, though.  Lush isn&#39;t exactly a quiet place of study.&quot;

Hmm... and I suppose I can tell you that he is quite the traditionalist. If you were to seek his favor, as a freewomb, I would recommend approaching him with as much grace and submission as you can muster.  I have noticed he rarely gives time to any girl not already in a collar.&quot;

[[&quot;Something to keep in mind.-&gt;BarQ]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="861" name="AskBar2" tags="" position="6326,18471" size="100,100">&quot;Of course,&quot; he replies readily.  &quot;Or at least that applies to the female staff within the building itself.  You may have noticed our building is quite large?  The back quarter is their living quarters.  And we have of course acquired them from Grand Aekora&#39;s own slave markets, their service here demonstrating in turn the value that can be found at this Ringdom&#39;s Prime Markets.&quot;

He looks to you, a bit apologetic.  &quot;For free males, that is.  I&#39;m sure you understand that given the rarity of my gender, and our usual wealth, concessions are made to their pleasure.  As a freewomb, access to our privileged areas would cost you 700 credits.&quot;

He points across the floor of Lush, to the ebon-skinned man near the stairs.  &quot;Talk to Charon if you would like to buy a pass, or one of our current VIP members grants you access.

Instead of resisting in any way to your groping, she remains still-- holding her tray and your used glass.  It&#39;s a testament to her training that she waits until you release her, looking for leave that you soon give her.  Only then does Cherish retreat.

Immediately you move to kiss her, but she holds a finger to your lips, halting you.  &quot;Close your eyes,&quot; despite the loud music of the Club, and the crowds moving all around you, her voice is almost a whisper.

It seems to have been what she was waiting for, as Cherish pulls her white-gloved hand from you.  To your shame, your hips follow, trying to further the contact, but Cherish remains firm.

Aekoran by birth too, actually.  Grew up on one of the sharecropping estates in the countryside.&quot;

She adjusts her glasses.  &quot;Obviously I wasn&#39;t from the family that owned the estate itself.  Most of them are Sargon or Naram-Sin owned, of course.&quot;

It&#39;s hard to tell if she genuinely felt that, or if she simply feared the consequences of admitting anything else.  Torean treatment of slaves could be quite strict indeed.

She gestures towards the ceiling, but you sense she meant places far further then that-- other planets.  The galaxy at large.

I made it about a year, but when things came down to charges against me from the Ministry of Truants, or a collar...&quot;

The band at her throat gleams brightly.

[[&quot;I understand now.&quot;-&gt;CherishQQ]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="899" name="CherishBig" tags="" position="8589,18654" size="100,100">Cherish listens, wide-eyed.

Her gloved hands splay, suddenly defensive.  &quot;Not that I meant anything by that, Mistress!&quot;

[[&quot;No harm done.  But I do have other questions.&quot;-&gt;CherishQQ]]

We have our own culture here, just as ancient as any of yours.&quot;

She seems strangely proud of it, given that culture had put her in a collar, and forced her into a uniform as tight and slutty as she wore.

[[&quot;Agreed.  Now, I have other questions?&quot;-&gt;CherishQQ]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="902" name="CherishBad" tags="" position="9039,18653" size="100,100">Your zeal for slavery and subservience are well demonstrated, although Cherish&#39;s pursed lips suggest she was biting down on giving you a taste of her mind.  Given her slavery, that was probably a well-honed survival instict.

She finally settles on a response with a bit of a smile.  &quot;You certainly are growing well-accustomed to how things work here, as an offworlder.  If a collar is what you seek, I&#39;m sure you will make a Master or Mistress very happy some day.&quot;

I would recommend being careful, while we allow such circumstances to persist, Truant Officers rarely approve of such recklessness.&quot;]

She lifts the front of her skirt, bowing to you.  &quot;You need only wait here, Mistress, to await my preparation for your use.  Another servant will be along shortly to escort you to the private room that will be at your disposal for the coming hour.&quot;

Moving away from you, Cherish stops at the bar, speaking with the bartender before making for the hallway marked with the neon pillow.  As promised, it&#39;s not long after before another uniformed slave approaches you.  She presents you with a key.

&quot;Room 12, Mistress.  She&#39;s waiting for you.&quot;

From several of the other doors you hear the sounds of revelry, be it music, conversation, or acts of sensuality.  And indeed, it was the promise of that last one that eventually brings you to stand before Door 12.  Reaching down, you press your keycard against the attendant pad, and it opens...

Cherish, still in her uniform, locked at wrist and ankle to an X-shaped frame.  

She&#39;s spread-eagle, defenseless, a baby blue ball firmly locked between her teeth.  Meeting your gaze, she smiles despite the gag, wriggling a bit in her restraints before looking down and to the side.  Next to her sits a small folding tray, displaying a handful of useful implements.

The slave is yours alone to play with.

Again she looks at the countdown, smiling.  &quot;Forty five hours is quite ambitious for an offworlder, ma&#39;am.  And you still have twelve hours remaining.  //Lucky...//&quot;

Release her entirely was impossible, but loosening the chains a bit to allow her to rest more easily on her heels would be possible.  Alternatively, however, at least two links each could be reduced by snapping them together, dramatically tightening her bondage.

For once Cherish speaks up immediately, having watched you reach for the whip.  Bound and gagged, utterly helpless, she tries to stay your hand with the only thing left to the slave-- her own body.  Pressing her chest out, her already lidded gaze grows even more sensual, an unspoken promise being made.

You still couldn&#39;t remember much of your own past, but here you now sat, deep in a Torean city-- a slave, collared and uniformed, bound for your pleasure, utterly helpless before you.  What strange paths we walk.

After some time, you eventually rouse.

Her skirt immediately intercedes, but you glide over that easily enough, the ruffled laminate of her petticoats providing little in the way of actual coverage or protection.  That allows you access to her panties, bright white and pulled tight between her legs, disappearing between the cleft of her rear.

The white buttons that decorate the front give way to the swell of her breasts beneath, your inquiring hands quickly ascertaining that each nipple is pierced-- which you twist softly, eliciting a quite moan as you continue on your way.

Her collar is a two part affair, the outermost a decorative bit of laminate, folded stylishly and buttoned at the front much like the bodice.  Beneath that however is a band of pure silvered steel, pulled tight against her throat.  The club&#39;s logo is emblazoned upon the front, as well as a serial code of some sort-- knowing Torei, of use to Truant Officers or the like.

Reaching her chin you&#39;re presented with an opportunity, however-- gagged as she is, cutting off her oxygen would be easy enough.  A mere pinch of the nose, for instant breathplay.  

Cherish looks to you, squirming slightly.

Further up she again looks to you, if not begging then certainly seeking your affection.

She gets it with two of your fingers being used to press against her lips, the presence of a piercing in her clit becoming immediately apparent.  That Cherish felt it too is made clear by the way she suddenly pulls against her bindings, moaning gently in her gag.  Your ministrations are gentle, but insistent, and its not long before she starts to pant-- and you abandon the effort, letting the tease be enough for now.

Her frustrated but happy mewl suggests approval nevertheless.

Further up she again looks to you, if not begging then certainly seeking your affection.

She does not get it.  Immediately you feel the presence of a ring piercing her clit, and focus upon it immediately, rubbing the sensative nub forcibly.  Cherish reacts as one might expect, pulling hard against her restraints as she tries to speak-- although her gag renders that into little more than muffled moans.  That you&#39;re having an effect is made apparent by the way her knees shift in, however, the only defensive measure she could manage as she begins to quiver from so much direct stimulation.  Bringing her to cum right then and there would have been easy enough, but it&#39;s then you back off suddenly, leaving her unsated.

Her upturned brows and quivering limbs speak to a distinct distaste for being so roughly treated.  Not that she has a choice.

The stockings themselves are as smooth as glossy as the rest of her uniform.  White bands at the top of each thigh give way to blue further down, until her heeled shoes become apparent at the very bottom, the towering platforms improving her height dramatically.

Yet her efforts allow you an excellent view of her bound body writhing, pert chest pressed out and swaying, full hips shifting back and forth.  

It&#39;s almost a shame when you finally decide to release her, the slave&#39;s nostrils flaring as she tries to suck in much desired oxygen.  For a moment she hangs loosely in her bindings, but does recover, eyes narrowed slightly in your direction.

You get the sense she didn&#39;t like that.

That gives you the slack to then loosen the binding by at least a full link, giving the bound slave that much more liberty.  Repeating the effort on her other limbs allows her to rest more easily.

Cherish responds by testing the new adjustment, her body momentarily straining against the bonds.  What she finds clearly pleases her, a nod of thanks being delivered your way.

A job well done.

That gives you the slack to then slip an additional two links of her chain upon the hook holding it there, instantly forcing her limb to pull taut against the cross behind it.  The slave notices the change immediately, pulling her to regain her lost liberty even as you progress to her other arm.

By the time you finish with all four, the uniformed woman&#39;s predicament had moved beyond mere helplessness to a direct discomfort, her body spread so forcibly you see her struggling-- and failing-- to find a comfortable position.  Drool runs down her gag and lands upon her chest in result, Cherish complainly openly with a low moan.

Thus her panties are easily accessible, your hand upon them working slowly to invade, until a singular finger slips beneath the slick laminate.  

Feeling the intrusion Cherish moans softly, pressing her hips out further, seeking your attention.

Even the slightest pull ellicits an immediate reaction from the slave, Cherish being like most women in that such direct stimulation could often be overwhelming.

Swiveling her hips to press them out further, she wantonly seeks your attention.

Her tone alone suggests the folly of such a decision, but ultimately Isabella pushes the thought away.

From the vantage of your approach, you get your first good look at the VIP member known as Tysus Sargon.  She&#39;s seated alone in the center of a crescent-shaped booth, the plush dark material drinking in the light of the club.  She would have been all but invisible had she not been focused on a haptic display projected before her, massive data tables running down before her as she leans in, adjusting black-rimmed glasses.

As should have perhaps been expected, her outfit is pure laminate, the strictly business look of her pencil skirt offset by the semi-transparent material of the shirt she wears, the front pulled open exposing the bra worn underneath.  That mixture of serious scholarship and playful sensuality seems to define her, from the outfit to her hair, black strands pulled into a tight bun-- but offset, producing an appeal asymmetrical effect.

At that moment she holds a stylus in her hand, tapping it gently against blood-red lips.  There is absolutely no doubt in your mind that she had failed to notice you, or much of anything else passing by.

You do.  Not the particulars, just the nature of your predicament, the need for a VIP sponsor.  She listens, the way she seems to be staring through you, the way her fingers rap against the table, you get the sense of impending dismissal-- until you happen to mention one small detail: the Black Card.

Sitting up sharply, Tysus looks to you intently.  You suddenly have her full and undivided attention.  &quot;Have you seen it?&quot;

She catches herself before running further into what you sense would have been a lengthy speech, and instead focuses, placing her hands on the table before looking to you again.

&quot;That black card you hold is... an exceptional item.  A direct communication from a *Daemon*.  I have so many questions... you *will* answer them.&quot;

She doesn&#39;t give you an opportunity to resist, but does-- after a moment-- provide a carrot to go along with that stick.  &quot;And I will answer any questions that you may have.  Tysus, of House Sargon, by the way.  Charmed.&quot;

Even so, she still doesn&#39;t offer you a seat.

There isn&#39;t much to tell, in truth, and you&#39;re not exactly sure how much of it you had perceived correctly.  Looking back on the experience it almost feels more like a dream, details slipping away as hour is stacked atop hour, and the encounter fades.  

&quot;That&#39;s not uncommon,&quot; the Mistress continues, as if sensing your confusion.  &quot;The one rule that we who research Daemons know for sure is that Daemons are erratic, acting in manners and ways we do not full understand.

Maintaining a distance from even those they have interest in is one of them.  Although...

She looks up, tilting her head to the side.  &quot;Wait a minute-- how did you come into possession of the Black Card, then?&quot;

The slave&#39;s gagged protestations are ignored, as instead you open the portal to the hallway beyond.

Another uniformed slave of the club awaits outside, her smile only *slightly* betraying the fact that you had hesitated before coming to the door.

&quot;Good evening, Mistress,&quot; she greets, performing a quick curtsy.  Much like Cherish, her skirt is scandously short.  &quot;I hope our Cherish provided a... pleasing experience?

She steps aside, allowing you to make your way past and back towards your table.

Meanwhile you take up the dildo, the artificial cock heavy, rendered in carefully crafted laminate.

At the door, a feminine voice speaks up.  &quot;Mistress?  Your time is up.  A late exit would incur a financial penalty!&quot;

With dildo in hand, Cherish seems quite keen that you ignore the warning.

[[Not worth it.  Set the dildo down and go to the door.-&gt;CEndDil]]

Again Cherish bucks against her restraints, eager for the cock.  How rare were her oppotunities for such treatment?

Hilting within her, the slave moans in the most lewd manner yet, her back arching as she pulls as hard as she could against her restraints.  Anything to further the pleasure between her legs. 

And further that pleasure you do, ramming her in quick succession with the cock, claiming her cunt with your phallic facsimile.  Already enthusiastic and well worked up, it doesn&#39;t take Cherish long to approach the peak of her desire.  Bucking once more in her bondage, breasts thrust out, she presses once more into her cuffs-- cumming **hard.**

Just as the door opens behind you.

She cannot help the moan that follows, but does look deep into your eyes afterward, begging without words for a reprieve-- for the opportunity to cum she was so often denied.

You don&#39;t give it to her.  Instead, when the door is finally unlocked behind you, you&#39;re just sliding the slick phallus from a deeply frustrated Cherish.

Of course.  Well, suffice it to say, House Sargon is one of the two Diarchic families in this Ringdom, along with House Naram-Sin.  We each control a Prime Market, the massive slave markets that are central to the Aekoran economy, and we both elect a Diarch-- one from each family making executive decisions.&quot;

She collects her hands together on the table.  &quot;House Sargon is very large, however.  Hundreds of existant members.  Instead of pursuing an administrative career, one that would lead into politics, I chose an academic one.&quot;

[[&quot;Interesting.&quot;-&gt;SargonPHub]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="993" name="SargonWhatUni" tags="" position="12010,19158" size="100,100">&quot;No,&quot; she replies immediately, but does clarify.  &quot;In that I mean that Daemonology isn&#39;t a particularly widespread discipline.  Only a few institutions of higher learning concern themselves with the polar AIs, and none of those in Aekora have that distinction.  But I do have degrees in Material Science, Engineering, and Sociology.&quot;

Given her youth, she must have been a prodigy.  Torean biomedical technology went far, but it hadn&#39;t expanded to the point of providing that sort of intelligence.

Tysus meanwhile shrugs her narrow shoulders.  &quot;They are useful disciplines for the study of Daemons, but in that particular field I am what one would call *self-taught*.&quot;

[[&quot;I see.&quot;-&gt;SargonPHub]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="994" name="SargonWhatSlaves" tags="" position="12160,19158" size="100,100">She pauses.  &quot;I do.  Although only a personal assistant.  My family provides a subsidy, of course, but if I am need of anything further I simply utilize my contacts with the nearby Finishing Academy.  They are always willing to lend me a few girls, if the need arises.  Otherwise, a scholar&#39;s life is not particularly flush with credits.&quot;

[[Of course.-&gt;SargonPHub]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="995" name="DaeWhatAre" tags="" position="12523,19163" size="100,100">As Tysus draws herself up, you realize you&#39;re in for a bit of a lecture.

&quot;Daemon,&quot; she begins, &quot;is a colloquial term, one generally carrying a negative connotation.  &#39;Emissary&#39; is another, much the opposite in that it is generally used by those intending a positive connotation.  The *proper* term, however, is an Isolation Laminate.&quot;

A professor in tone and appearance if not demeanor, Tysus adjusts her glasses before continuing.  &quot;I prefer the term &#39;Daemon&#39; because I think it important to not forget their origin, but &#39;Isolation Laminate&#39; does drill to the heart of the matter-- in that with most everything regarding such creatures, we are speaking of the suit.  A human does reside within, but in a state we cannot fully speak to.  The suit controls them, conditions them, enslaves them.&quot;

[[&quot;Where do they come from?&quot;-&gt;DaeWhere]]
[[&quot;What do they want?&quot;-&gt;DaeWhat]]
[[&quot;So are the humans within aware?&quot;-&gt;DaeAware]]

Imagine that.  Mazos and Dahome are beings of infinite wisdom, vast and terrible, more akin to forces of nature or even *Gods* then anything we can understand in our frail morality.  When you stand face to face with a Daemon, you are in turn looking into the eye of impossible vastness-- and it has broken from its cosmic divinity to look back into you.&quot;

But I shall indulge you.  Ask.&quot;

Both generally, in that I am on location, and specifically-- in that I am in this booth, on the ground level instead of the VIP.  From here I can watch all entrances and exits to the Club.

Did you know this planet isn&#39;t... *natural?*  It was constructed, from stellar dust and debris, by the polar AIs.  Mazos and Dahome, as we call them.  They built this planet over passing aeons, then cultivated its atmosphere-- and finally set to work on populating it.  Thus the first humans were bred, but when they proved unruly... the Isolation Laminates.  Leave it to an artifical intelligence to take such an efficient approach, converting dissidents into slave-overseers.&quot;

Tysus flicks open an annotated timeline upon her holographic display, its sheer length demonstrating Torei&#39;s great age.  &quot;We broke free, of course.  After the Sharecropping Wars, the first Ringdoms were founded.  But the AIs still have their slaves, deep within their polar ziggurats-- and the occasional unfortunate in an Isolation Laminate still walks among us.  Daemons, haunting outer villages and performing strange acts in the night to some.  Emissaries to others, providing boons and communicating-- as best they can-- the desires of their AI Masters.&quot;

[[&quot;What do they want?&quot;-&gt;DaeWhat]]
[[&quot;So are the humans within aware?&quot;-&gt;DaeAware]]
[[&quot;Why use humans at all?&quot;-&gt;DaeWhyHuman]]

One arm stretches out along the top, the other gesturing as she speaks.  &quot;Simply put: we do not know.  To understand their intentions, you would need to understand their Masters-- and the polar AIs are beyond strange.  They do no think as we do, they do not have personalities to interact with, we are not even sure if their consciousness is gestalt, unified, or some other obscure form of sentience.  Think... think of the Daemons as a thousand fingers emerging from a terrifying hand, so vast as to be almost infinite.  We cannot hope to perceive what such a hand would intend to grasp.&quot;

[[&quot;So are the humans within aware?&quot;-&gt;DaeAware]]

Leading theories suggest the prisoner, if we may use that term, is perhaps in a perpetual fugue state.  Slipping into and out of perception of the world beyond their Isolation Laminate.  Daemons have been observed working through pleasure cycles, however-- a clear indicator of the human within being stimulated.&quot;

But why persist in this program, after so many centuries?  I do have a theory, though.&quot;

She leans in.  &quot;They persist because we allow it.  Most Ringdoms maintain strict non-interaction laws with Daemons, and in turn they wander freely.  Eyes and ears for the AIs, nudging the events in their grand machinations.&quot;

Fully.  Of that we are certain.  From helmet to heels, which yes-- both genders wear.  The material itself is laminate, much like you or I bear, but the AIs have ensured only the Daemons have access to what is clearly a more advanced composition.  Details vary, and as always firsthand reports are rare, but shape-shifting of a limited variety as well as complete vacuum protection have been reported.  That they persist on internal air recycling has been demonstrated rather simply, by a lack of observed condensation from breathing in colder environments.&quot;

Tysus pauses.  &quot;What the suit inflicts upon its wearer in such a closed environment is not altogether clear, however.  (if: $Slave is true)[I would think it somewhat comparable to your own circumstances, however.&quot;  

She gestures towards your standardized slave suit.

[[&quot;Like my suit?&quot;-&gt;DaeSlaveSS]]](else:)[I imagine it being something like that which we inflict upon slaves wearing the standardized suit some in this Ringdom require of slaves in this Ringdom, if you have ever witnessed such a situation.

There is a reason there has never been a confirmed capture of a Daemon for more then a few hours.  Most commonly we get reports of electric discharge from their gloves-- akin a shock baton.  Their suits can shift in shape to a limited degree as well, forming blades or most anything else they need.  And *that* is all on top of their strength.  Once again, theories vary as to the particulars of how they do it but they can demonstrate exceptional strength at times-- such as bending steel bars, or the like.  Those suits are incredible.

Given their abilities, the apparent semi-direct control exerted over them-- they must require constant power infusions, right?  Well you would be wrong.  Daemons have been observed operating for several weeks unimpeded, and even longer while sitting... or bound... in dormant states.  But this is one of the subjects in which we *do* understand how they do it.  Are you familiar with piezoelectricty?&quot;

She doesn&#39;t wait for you to actually reply, continuing instead.  &quot;Certain materials can generate electricty in response to mechanical stress... such as the metallic boning of a corset.  Yes it enforces the intended waistline, but with every breath the wearer stresses the material-- and we have nigh-infinite energy.&quot;

The Mistress actually smiles for once.  &quot;Even the male Daemons are corseted, if you&#39;re wondering.  Serves them right, I have alwas wondered why only us women generally wear such things...&quot;

The best I can respond with is... *perhaps*.  Within the polar ziggaruts that are both the bodies of Mazos and Dahom, as well as the prisons that hold their human slaves, we believe there are... something like living quarters.  Some theories suggest that those within the Isolation Laminates *are* eventually released into such areas, after their terms of service are done.&quot;

There are of course stories of damaged Isolation Laminates, of brief escapes from them... but it&#39;s strange, they always seem to end the same way: with the slave returning from whence they came.  Back into the clutches of the AI.  What madness would drive them to that?&quot;

She lets you ponder the question for a moment, but as always has an answer of her own ready.  &quot;I think it most likely that the experience of wearing such a suit... changes a person.&quot;

It&#39;s a request he considers for a only a moment, the effort you put in to earn that moment intensive, the actual work required of him to sate it insignificant.  Thus was the Torean way.

&quot;These were the terms negotiated, I suppose.  And I hardly care for the VIP area, not when the floor down here is so full of ambition and desperation.  If this boon is truly what you seek, I will grant it.  At your leisure, you may tell the guard near the stairs that you have my sponsorship, so to speak.&quot;

You may still have your own goals, your own motivations, but in that moment it&#39;s impossible to ignore the simple fact that Torei had placed its indelible mark upon your soul.  

Would it all prove worth it?  It seems you could now go and see.  With Petros&#39; sponsorship, the stairs that ascended to the VIP section should be opened-- and with it, finally, the meeting you had tracked all this way and endured so much to reach.  

*Now if only you could remember what it was truly for.*

Given Lush&#39;s large bar, and its distinct collection of intoxicants both Torean and Offworld-originating, its perhaps no small wonder they kept a extra stock back here.

Beyond that, you don&#39;t see much of interest.

Most appear to feature different means of interacting with the female anatomy, be it via vibrating nubs, plunging phalli, or in one particular case something that looks like a pulley lined with metallic tabs-- to which purpose you can only imagine.

Lush&#39;s slaves apparently had their work cut out for them, on occasion.

[[Step back.-&gt;BRStorage]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1119" name="BRStorageP" tags="" position="16022,18158" size="100,100">Several posters, larger then you are tall even with the added height of your heels, are collected in the storage room&#39;s corner.  Moving to unfurl the first, if only to sate your idle curiosity, its then you notice something else behind the posters.  Pushing them aside takes a good moment, but when you do you&#39;re rewarded with an unexpected sight: a door, obviously hidden.  Just where it went is impossible to determine, the portal lacking any manner of view beyond it.  You do however find something else jammed into the doorframe itself, a small folding blade.  Given its position, it almost looked like someone had been trying to pry the door open.  It doesn&#39;t appear they succeeded, and you see no other way of opening it.

(if: $BRGag is true)[(set: $BRCut to true)The blade is small, but appears to be exactly the sort needed to cut through the laminate restraints holding Akrai.  You decide to take it with you.]

Torei was a land of strange wonders, after all, and you&#39;re still a prospector.  If you could just chip off a bit of the collected cultural wealth of this planet, enough to run with to the stars, you would be set for life.  

Taking a deep breath, you move across the balcony towards the darkened hallway beyond.  Neon labels upon each door chart your path through the desolate sea, until you come upon the island of light that Cherish had mentioned upon your entering-- VIP Suite #4.

Peeking inside the icebox reveals it to be well stocked, a fact that is perhaps a bit surprising given how slaves on Torei were generally treated.  Perhaps it served as a perk?  You&#39;re certainly hungry enough to consider it a proper proposition, but cannot sate that desire now-- someone could still walk in at any moment, and you&#39;re here for a reason after all.

She shuffles the thinprint laminate sheets on the desk before her.  &quot;Offworld-born pop star Reya Tianna shocked fans today by revealing that she had accepted a collar, and will be retiring from public performances to fulfill its obligations.  Tianna has not revealed the name of her new owner, and speculation runs rampant as for her reasoning for entering into service, but many have been quick to point with the singer&#39;s twice extended stay on Torei and images of her from earlier this month in strict bondage indicating what could be a sincere desire for enslavement.&quot;

The newswoman smiles.  &quot;Offworlder protests have been reported as fierce, but when pressed for comment local officials have confirmed the legitimacy of Miss Tianna&#39;s right to servitude, a proud Torean cultural heritage and institution.&quot;

It takes a moment, but with a bit of shock you finally realize what made it so very Torean.  Instead of horses, or other creatures of burden, each chariot is instead pulled by a team of six women-- ponygirls-- each team of them wearing the same brightly colored laminate beneath their tack and harness.  Given the cloven heels each are wearing you&#39;re surprised to see them maintaining a full sprint easily, although the way their drivers lash them mercilessly from on high explains their motivation.  

As you watch a team crosses the finishline, breaking a laminate band stretched across the field.  They&#39;re met with furious applause and cheering from the stands as the camera rushes towards the driver for what soon becomes a post-race interview.  Of the panting, moaning women locked together nearby little attention is given.

Given the reference to longwave, you conclude this particular channel has to be coming in from far away, perhaps bounced off the atmosphere from the other side of the planet.

If the channel itself is ancient, the program playing is almost beyond time itself.  It appears to document a mother and daughter&#39;s fictionalized life on a homestead in what&#39;s referred to as the &#39;Lichen Belt&#39;, an area depicted as mostly desolate.  What&#39;s most shocking however are the slaves, many included in the background almost as an afterthought-- one baking in the kitchen, another locked spread-eagled to the wall of the family&#39;s home, two more distantly pulling a plow in the fields.

If this was a view of rural Torei, it seemed the ease of obtaining slaves applied even there.

Flipping through several pages reveals an examination of upcoming fashion lines, the current fad being based around exclusivity.   Instead of being freely available from Wardrobe devices, it appears most of the current designs must be special ordered preformed.

Locking around your wrists and ankles, waist and throat, it quickly forces you into a position with legs spread and arms held out to your sides.

*Stripping process intialized.*

Just what *that* meant is soon clarified, as a ring descends from above, spraying every inch of your body coated with laminate.  Whatever it was doing, the effect is immediate, your formally glossy material dulling then beginning to run down your body into the drain below.  Those parts that were reinforced with metal or other accessories are caught as they collapse, being stored within the machine as it makes a second pass, cleaning off any lingering residue with a violet glow that leaves you as utterly naked.

You writhe in impotent distress for as long as the pulse of electricity is discharged through you-- by empirical observation a few seconds, but for what feels like an eternity.  

Finally, however, it ceases.  You&#39;re left in the wake, moaning softly in your restraints.  Yet the Wardrobe is hardly done yet.

This one however is sheer, unbridled euphoria.  Igniting a fire between your legs, then pouring gasoline upon it until it blazed-- all but out of control.

But it too ends, suddenly, too suddenly.  Instinctively you drive your hips out, seeking more, anything to fuel that fire already fluttering.  The futility of the maneuver is clear, however.  You&#39;re left unsatisfied, frustrated, and more then a little humiliated.  The Wardrobe chimes in response.

*Testing successful.  Starting uniform application...*

As this new step engages, the large ring ascends from where it had halted below.  This time instead of dissolving an outfit, it applies it, utilizing a swarm of small nozzles mounted on armatures.  Powder blue stockings are formed around your feet, then ankles, calves, and thighs.  At their top it provides a decoratory white band before progressing into garters that are ran up even further.  A garter belt and panties are formed, both stark white in coloration, before the Wardrobe begins on the main piece of your new uniform.

What becomes your bodice and skirt is carefully formed as a singular piece, from your shoulders down to the decorative faux-belt at your waist.  From there it expands, careful pleating created alongside a ruffled petticoat the skirt itself *just* fails to cover.  Indeed the entire ensemble is quite short, exposing the meeting of your thighs and thus the panties there with even the barest of movements.  With the application of your sleeves, the shoulders ruffled while the arms are tight leading to white gloves, the Wardrobe then shifts to accessories.

High-heeled pumps are extruded from the floor, immediately forcing you onto your toes while providing a considerable height addition-- the platforms are quite large.  Further up a decorate collar is built around your throat, the blue laminate serving as a choker while also featuring ornamental folds to each side.  Final additions come in the form of a small headpiece, a fascinator marked with Club Lush&#39;s logo upon the button near its center, and a pair of glasses.  The red frames provide a splash of alternative color, but do nothing for your sight.

The printing ring completes its path by rising above you, recessing in the Wardrobe&#39;s ceiling as every other armature retreats-- save one that instead emerges, gripping a thin band of metal.  Built of simple stainless steel, what you quickly identify as a proper slave&#39;s collar is aligned with your throat then pressed against it.  The band is installed over the innermost portion of your decorative laminate choker, emerging to visiblity between the folds that flank each side.  

It&#39;s impossible to miss the sharp report of the collar&#39;s lock clicking closed.

One by one your liberty is restored until you stand alone within the Wardrobe, atop your freshly formed platform heels.  Even the barest movement of your hips shifts your shirt, flaring it suggestively given the length (or lack thereof).  Worse, the same movement allows you to feel the pull of your panties against the ring now piercing your clitoris. 

*Dressing sequence completed.*

You emerge from the Wardrobe unequivocally changed.  Your outfit is different of course, but so is your body, modified with steel to augment and control your sensuality.  And there is the collar of course, your ID card being returned to you upon exit.  FREEWOMB is still labeled along the top, but over it fresh black ink has been applied, spelling our your new status.

**SLAVE**

You&#39;re not even sure to *whom*.  Probably whoever owned Lush.  Hopefully, if everything went to plan however, it wouldn&#39;t particularly matter.  You now have the means to slip past that bouncer at the VIP stairs, to make your appointment.  Play this right, and you should be able to simply leave the Club afterward-- and make for the Way Up.  By this time tomorrow you could very well be safe in the space station on the far end of the elevator, where Torei&#39;s laws did not apply.

Especially the footwear.  Since your dressing this morning you&#39;ve been forced into heels, but the platforms on these are a new experience, requiring an adjustment to your gait that takes a bit of practice.  But you manage, even making it look natural as you push through the final door and emerge back out into the Club proper-- next to the stage.

There you pause, taking a moment to observe.  Thankfully, your intrusion into the backrooms seems to have gone undetected.  The party is still in full swing, and from your vantage you can see several of Lush&#39;s other slaves, going about their duties in uniforms exactly the same as your own.  At the foot of the stairs the bouncer remains in place as well, arms crossed, looking just as imposing as when you had first met him.

Your moment&#39;s pause is justified by a fact you hadn&#39;t noticed before, however-- those servants who went upstairs always had one of the Club&#39;s silver trays, drink in hand.  And you don&#39;t have one.

Would the bartender recognize you, though?

Alternatively, you see another tray resting on a booth&#39;s table along the side wall.  The bartender is not near it, and neither are any of the other serving girls.  But the booth itself is occupied, by two men and two women who appear to be tourists.  

Or you could simply make for the stairs regardless.  Perhaps the Bouncer did not pay particular attention?

Perhaps finding a tray *was* a good decision you muse, as the bouncer hardly pays you much attention-- and indeed ignores you altogether when a passing tourist inquires about the VIP area he was guarding.  Slipping by, you mount the stairs, undoubtedly providing anyone below with a clear upskirt view given the short length of your new uniform... but that couldn&#39;t be helped.  Setting the tray down upon the arm of a nearby recliner, you can at last exhale.  You made it.

[[The VIP area awaits.-&gt;VIPStart]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1175" name="ServTake" tags="" position="15509,21150" size="100,100">The tourists in the booth around the table seem embroiled in a conversation, some story regarding the spacecraft that had brought them to Torei, as you reach for the tray.  Just as your gloved hands fall upon it, however, one of the women points your way.

&quot;Hey!  Not even going to ask if we need anything?&quot;  She laughs, looking to the male at her side.  &quot;Do it to her, Arnsel!&quot;

Laughing in turn, Arnsel reaches for the control panel built into the booth-- pressing a button that immediately results in a sharp snap of pain running up from between your legs.  Apparently you were already synced to the Club&#39;s systems, although its a thought that emerges as a whimpered moan.

That draws amusement from all four of your tormentors.

Aren&#39;t you supposed to do the thing?  Lifting your skirt and showing your panties, I mean?&quot;

She laughs, clearly drunk.

Already drawn up beside the table you lift the front of your skirt and petticoat, revealing the smooth white laminate of your panties as you bow your head in greeting.

It goes over with much approval from the tourists, the loudest woman around them clapping her hands.  &quot;Arnsel,&quot; she laughs, &quot;do the thing!  We&#39;re supposed to reward them!&quot;

Just what that meant is revealed by the male beside her reaching towards the booth&#39;s control panel, pressing a button.  The ring embedded in your clit sends a shiver of pleasure through you as a result, a wet moan slipping past your lips unexpectedly.  That just seems to please the group further.

&quot;Oh-- it&#39;s *you!*&quot;  What had been frustration shifts upon his face, turning into a smile.  &quot;I just *knew* you would make it.  No one turns it down.  And to think I thought you would be late!&quot;

He seems to recognize the confusion that forms across your face (if: $Slave is true)[despite your breath regulating mask interceding], but misunderstands its source-- and diagnoses incivility.  &quot;Where are my manners-- please, come in, come in.

So too are you able to look over the man properly, his attire also laminate, a smart suitcoat and tailored trousers rendered in dark grey.  His tie is half undone however, a bit of dishevelment that&#39;s matched by the parlor you&#39;ve entered into.  A sitting room can be seen through a doorframe to your left, and before you another door stands closed, but its within this small antechamber itself that it appears the man had been waiting for you.

Rubbing his hands together, he smiles widely.  &quot;So-- you&#39;re here!&quot;

*Daemon.*

&quot;It&#39;s just through the door, with its offer.  Just as I promised when I delivered to you the Black Card, at that hotel you were staying at.  Just as I promised when I called you, to come back to Torei.&quot;

*His words send you reeling.  Your deal* **was** *with a Daemon, even if this stranger was serving as a middle-man of sorts.  Turning towards the door he had indicated, the closed one that presumably led to a bedroom, its almost like you can sense it.  A slice of divinity, if the AIs were Gods, puppeting a human body like a laminate marionette-- so very close now.  Waiting for you.  With an offer.*

You break from the reverie to find your hand upon the door, all but ready to push it open.

[[At least... hear it out.  If it could even speak.-&gt;VIPDae2]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1213" name="VIPDae2" tags="" position="17497,20146" size="100,100">&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/rFMXUfL.jpg&quot; width=&quot;30%&quot; height=&quot;30%&quot;&gt;

The Daemon, the Emissary, waits for you in the center of the room.  (if: $Daemon is true)[You saw it before, in that alleyway back on the streets, and its much the same as you had glimpsed there.] Its body is uniformly covered in black laminate, stripping it of any individuality or sense of self.  There is no discernable face, only the glossy material remains, stretched so tightly across a male frame as evidenced by narrow hips and wide shoulders. Even so that masculinity is *intense*, as if the Daemon condensed it, adding potency as everything else was stripped away.  In that wake of simplified existance you feel your own curvaceous body all the more readily.  The swell of your breasts, the smooth run from hip to waist, your pert rear-- the other side of the Daemon&#39;s equation.

It reaches out its hand.

[[Take it.-&gt;VIPDae3]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1214" name="VIPDae3" tags="" position="17496,20296" size="100,100">It has no words for you, and you realize then you wouldn&#39;t need any.  Its grip is firm, having seized your wrist instead of interlocking fingers as equals, drawing you further into the room-- away from the door back into the foyer, and closer to the bed.  Where something is laid out upon it.

A suit.  Black as a night without stars, yet so very reflective, promising to fill that void with sources of light all its own.  Smooth.  Glossy.  Featureless and all-consuming.  And yet... *familiar*.  Standing there before it, it takes you awhile, but you recognize it.  This... was no ordinary suit.  This was *your* isolation suit.  Careful measurement could have confirmed it, but your gut reaction is more then enough, akin to looking into a mirror.  A mirror just like that one you awoke to this morning in that hotel, a mirror you gaze into deeply, seeing not your own reflection but something... else.  A shadow of pleasure and ecstasy.

The male lifts the helmet, split into two portions yet lacking any hint of a seam.  Within you see the impression of a face-- your face.  And with it comes recollection.

[[You put it all together.-&gt;VIPDae4]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1215" name="VIPDae4" tags="" position="17496,20443" size="100,100">There were never material riches in this deal, and this isn&#39;t your first time on Torei.  As Corinth had suggested, you had come to this planet once, then twice, then again and again-- utterly enthralled by its possibilities.  But you had never indulged, Corinth and the hotel worker had made that clear as well.  An odd mixture of intrigue and restraint, perhaps that was what had drawn them to you.  The polar AIs, through their Daemon, with an offer you came to fear you would not-- could not-- refuse.  

Thus the Mem-Burn, the self-bondage.  A last desperate attempt to run out the clock, to force the missing of this rendezvous and drive you once more to the Way Up, this time without reason to return.  But you had underestimated even yourself, the will that had driven you to this point now all but handing you over to the Daemon.  To an offer of rapture and euphoria unending, all for the mere cost of your eternal liberty.  

This was the deal you stood to make.

[[The helmet is yours, you need only take it...-&gt;VIPDae5]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1216" name="VIPDae5" tags="" position="17496,20595" size="100,100">That damnable resolve that had driven you here does not break under the strain, however.  This deal is not yet done.  But the choice lies starkly before you, that helmet awaiting your presence.  

To take it would be to give yourself to the AI.  Inscrutable, unknowable, as harsh and alien as any being in this universe could be.  It would take your body, your liberty, your every waking moment.  But in return?  The potential for bliss unending, delivered by an immortal AI with untold millennia of experience in the arts of sensuality.  Free of conflict and worry, of responsibilities and dilemma.

To refuse it would be to set sail upon entirely unknown waters, knowledge of the depths scrubbed away by the Mem-Burn.  Perhaps there will be reefs ahead on which you will founder, to sink anyway.  Or maybe-- just maybe-- you could still make it to the Way Up.  Escape Torei.  Break free from the grasp of artifical divinities and mortal Truant officers alike.

The choice is yours.

[[Take the helmet.-&gt;VIPTake]]
[[Refuse the helmet.-&gt;VIPRefuse]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1217" name="VIPTake" tags="End-Count" position="17359,20805" size="100,100">&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/RgEruqK.png&quot; width=&quot;30%&quot; height=&quot;30%&quot;&gt;

You accept.  Gods help you, you take the helmet into your hands.  (if: $Slave is true)[From behind you feel the Daemon removing your breath regulating mask, then slowly peeling away your hood-- giving you a brief taste of freedom even as you lift the helmet.]  Slowly, ever so slowly, you bring it up towards your waiting face.  How could it this easy, to give up everything?  But it is.  Damn it all, it&#39;s as easy as pressing the helmet to your face.  Closer and closer, until finally-- with glorious finality, you feel the impossibly soft laminate of the AI&#39;s construction for the very first time.  It envelopes your lips, your nose, your chin-- then your entire head in its cool embrace.  You&#39;re blinded, gagged, deaf, helpless, even as you feel the Daemon moving the back portion into place to complete the seal.

Afterward he presses against you, masculinity and femininity joining in rapturous union that takes the form of a simple embrace.  Even this first experience feels so strange, so wonderful, so terrifying-- and its only just begun.

You&#39;re *Lost in Laminate*, and couldn&#39;t be happier.

To look upon its wonders and yet be held apart by an ironclad sense of dignity and restraint.  These past few hours since waking, the only ones you can fully remember, had seen to the demolition of that restraint.  Now more primal intrigues run rampant, calling for the helmet, for senseless acceptace of eternal servitude.

The words break the spell, your own reflection catching in the glossy play of light along the mask.  You step back, even as the Daemon remains, still holding the helmet.

Spinning on your heels, you flee.  Bursting through the door back into the foyer, you startle the man waiting there from his seat, his confusion evident even as you push by in a flurry of snapping heels and glossy laminate.

You leave the suite in as much of a sprint as you can handle, (if: $Ballet is true)[nearly tripping in your ballet heels,] you make for the lights and sounds of Club Lush.  Every pounding beat from the music helps to push the allure of the Daemon from your mind, and with a deep sigh of relief you emerge onto the balcony-- coming up against the railing.

And it&#39;s from there that you can see Truant Officers moving through the crowd.

[[What is going on!?-&gt;VIPTruant]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1222" name="VIPTruant" tags="" position="17575,21359" size="100,100">From your vantage, you can clearly see two main groups of Officers, one covering the Club&#39;s front exit and the other the rear.  The party is still in full swing, Cherish had mentioned such sweeps weren&#39;t uncommon, but they do appear to be coordinating so as to check in at every table and with every patron.

(if: $BRVIP is true)[Far more distressingly, you notice Akrai&#39;s dark red catsuit with black accessories near the front-- she&#39;s pinned against the wall by two officers, while a third is directing several more both towards the backroom entrance and towards the VIP stairs.  The damnable woman must have been trying to escape, only to have been caught in the sweep-- and if she mentioned your presence in the backrooms, having freed her?  At the very least they had to be suspecting someone.](else-if: $BarSaw is true)[Far more distressingly, you notice the bartender talking with several officers near the front door.  He&#39;s pointing to another of the serving girls, and then in turn towards the VIP stairs.  The implication is clear: he *had* recognized you, somehow.](else-if: $TourAng is true)[Far more distressingly, you can see the tourists you interacted with earlier near the front of the Club, speaking with the bartender and several Officers.  It appears your earlier storming away from them had led to their promised seeking of a manager, who undoubtedly realized you were not of the Club&#39;s usual workforce.](else-if: $Bouncered is true)[Far more distressingly, you can see the VIP section&#39;s bouncer near the front of the door, speaking with several of the Officers.  If you had been concerned he had recognized your deception upon passing without a tray, that appears to confirm it.](else-if: $SargonNo is true)[Far more distressingly, you can see Tysus Sargon speaking with several Officers near the front doors.  She&#39;s gesturing aggressively with her hands, then towards the stairs leading up to the balcony upon which you stand.  She *had* expressed a desire to see you punished for refusing to tell her about your deal, and it very much looks like she&#39;s making good on the threat now.](else-if: $SargonBother is true)[Far more distressingly, you can see Tysus Sargon speaking with several Officers near the front doors.  She&#39;s gesturing aggressively with her hands, then towards the stairs leading up to the balcony upon which you stand.  She *had* expressed a desire to see you punished after bothering her too far about being taken up into the VIP area, and it very much looks like she&#39;s making good on the threat now.](else-if: $PetrosTry is true and $PetrosFail is true)[Far more distressingly, you notice Petros standing near the front with several other Officers.  You&#39;re familiar enough with his body language that even masked as he is you can make out anger, apparently being directed towards the VIP section&#39;s stairs behind you.  He *had* spoken of a desire to see you punished after failing to please him, and it appears he&#39;s now making good on that threat.](else:)[Miraculously you believe you&#39;ve avoided making any enemies during your time at Lush, or at the very least you don&#39;t see any particular attention being directed towards the balcony you stand upon, but you could never really feel safe with Truant Officers around.]

(if: $debt is &lt; 0)[There is the matter of your account balance to consider as well, your efforts having run you down into negative territory.  If they&#39;re checking for debtors, and its reasonable to assume they would, you have a major problem on your hands.](if: $Servant is true)[ And of course, it simply would *not* end well if they found you wearing the collar and uniform of a Lush slave.  Even ignoring the possibility of the contract you signed actually being enforced, they could also charge you for false impersonation-- or probably a myriad of other, far more Torean crimes.](if: $Slave is true)[And of course, you just *know* they are unlikely to treat a freewomb in a slave-coded uniform very well.  That&#39;s just to be expected.]

If those Officers detain you, there will be no way for you to make it back to the the Way up.  You cannot risk it.

A quick count reveals about a dozen officers, four near the front door, six at the rear, two moving through the Club itself.  That made sense-- as you had seen on your way in, most of the traffic the Club saw used the rear entrance, while the front was reserved for men or those freewombs willing to pay a premium.
(set: $EscapePath to 0)(set: $TruantCount to 0)(set: $Wanted to 0)
Unfortunately it becomes quite clear that your options are limited, and your quickly running out of time.  Deciding on focusing on the front door is easy enough, given the fewer Officers.  But what then?  The most straightforward approach would be to simply approach them, although that would be akin to giving yourself up if they had any particular reason to arrest you.  Still-- anything else would be suspicious at the very least.

Alternatively, you could try to blend in with the crowds, then make a run for it if they noticed you.  (if: $CherishPlan is true)[With Cherish&#39;s promised assistance, perhaps you could even pull it off(if: $Servant is true)[-- although given your new uniform, and the fact none of the other similarly dressed slaves are near the door?  Perhaps not].](else:)[The chances of success seem quite low, however.  It looks like they&#39;re checking everyone leaving or entering(if: $Servant is true)[, and certainly none of the other slaves dressed like you are being let through].]

The only other option would be something far more... dramatic.  Turning to your left, you can see a small panel built into the wall, painted red.  FIRE ALARM is stenciled atop it.  Pulling that would incite chaos, making it almost trivial to slip out... but that would be blatantly illegal, the consequences unknown.

Your Isolation Laminate is as perfect as you had been lead to believe.  Moreso even.  The experience of wearing it, in its entirety, is beyond description.  And that was *before* the pleasure cycles had started.  You lost count of your orgasms somewhere in the twenties, and that had been hours ago when it had directed you to the bed.  Now you&#39;re utterly lost to the rapture, to its pleasure.  Sometimes the male joins you, but other times he&#39;s absent from the room.  You&#39;re not sure why.  It&#39;s not your concern.

Is the absence of ecstasy a feeling?  Already you cannot imagine it, but look upon it like a nightmare, horrific and unreal.  Only the shame remains, and that grows dimmer with each sensation that emanates from your tortured, rapturous cunt.  The thought of your womanhood sends your hands downward, playing across your encapsulated breasts, down along your strictly corseted waist, to the meeting of your thighs.  You cannot enter yourself, *They* have already claimed you, but the suit rewards your promiscuity nevertheless.  Pleasure atop pleasure.  Writhing, moaning, you cum again.

If you admitted to *yourself* you could not control what was happening to you, there would be no guilt.  Just pleasure.  Always pleasure.  You cum again, arching your back, feeling the suit sucking on your nipples, draining some liquid down your throat.  The details didn&#39;t matter, not when you could be cumming again.

But instead They ask you to rise, and you do.  Why wouldn&#39;t you?  The male awaits, perhaps he had been beside the bed this entire time.  He presses his hand against your sealed cunt, claiming it.  But it was not him, it was Them.  Just as your hand against his bulge is not your own, its their will-- you just obey.  Together you submit, as you always will.  

You emerge out into daylight, the warmth of it upon your obsidian skin so very wonderful.  Where are you?  It doesn&#39;t matter.  What are you doing?  It doesn&#39;t matter.  

The crowds along the sidewalks part as you pass, their whispered words allowed to reach your ears.

She was taking to her Isolation Laminate well, just as you had imagined.  An offworlder, well traveled and curious, a story similar to your own.  Perhaps that was why you had been directed to offer the Black Card, to meet with her in this dimly lit warehouse.  To make an offer, a deal, one she had accepted.  And thus They would have another to question, to examine, to learn more of the galaxy you and she had traveled so extensively.

But motives hardly matter.  Instead you&#39;re directed to submit, and of course you do.  You would further her pleasure, quicken the transition. Thus they command. Kneeling atop the bags that served as her bed, your black laminate bodies press together and she rouses, eagerly embracing you.

The near stampede you had incited now prevents your escape as the Officer grabs you roughly, and in that moment you recognize her.

Just as you reach the safety of a busy crosswalk some ways further out you look back, and catch sight of a familiar woman.

&quot;I know it was her, I swear I saw her in the crowd!&quot;  She tells the other Officer beside her.  &quot;The one from earlier today!  Come on, let&#39;s put out a bulletin.&quot;

Thankfully she doesn&#39;t notice you, but the implication is clear: you&#39;re soon to be a wanted woman on Torei.  Even fleeing the Ringdom wouldn&#39;t help, as the Ministry of Truants stretched beyond borders.  There is nothing you can do about it, though, and thus you instead move off further-- until coming to a halt several blocks away to take stock.

Their Ministry&#39;s favorite weapon is deployed with blunt determination, being slid quickly between your legs before the switch is flicked.  The electrical discharge is *intense*, your laminate offering absolutely zero protection as you&#39;re given a good long taste.

Afterward, gasping a bit from the experience, the Officer drags you far more easily towards your fate.

[[Ouch...-&gt;VIPArrest5]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1262" name="VIPArrest5" tags="" position="16961,24097" size="100,100">Just what &#39;being put with the others&#39; meant is revealed soon after, as the Officer leads you towards a machine somewhere between a proper flatbedded vehicle and a smaller transport device.  Marked with the Ministry of Truant&#39;s livery, its a sensible enough choice for a police force operating within Grand Aekora&#39;s strange covered walkways.  A crowd is formed around it already, the reason why becoming clear as the Officer pushes through.

The back of the vehicle is a flatbed, atop which are stacked a number of steel cages.  Featuring bars on all four sides, with what appears to be a top portion that could be unlocked to provide access, they&#39;re quite small-- and already some are occupied.  The prisoners are dressed in varying manners, undoubtedly because they were picked up somewhere else tonight by the Officers sweeping the Clubs, but their situation is universal.  Each is locked into an individual cage, laying on her back with legs folded but spread.  Some are gagged and most are moaning, but the sound of vibrators at work is universal.  Each cage also has a pair of handcuffs clipped just outside, and it appears many of the unfortunates have their wrists restrained by them, the bars far enough apart to allow hands to pass through at least.

Leading you to an empty cage, the Officer swings the top panel open.

&quot;This one is all yours, (if: $Servant or $Slave is true)[slave](else:)[whore.]&quot;  She unfastens your cuffs, although maintains a firm grip on your shoulder in the event you suddenly grew skittish.  &quot;Up and in you go now, just like the others.  Works best if you lay back first, then fold in your legs.  You *will* keep them spread.&quot;

From there you lean back carefully, settling back down into a cage just barely wide enough to hold you-- and certainly not long enough.  As you had observed of the others, and as the Officer had commanded, you&#39;re thus forced to fold your legs and spread them, allowing you just enough clearance to be below the lip.

To your left a woman in red and black laminate watches you with forlorn eyes, her red laminate catsuit ornamented with black accessories.  (if: $BRVIP is true)[You recognize her as Akrai, what must have been a failed escape attempt having now caught you up as well.  With a laminate panel across her lips and presumably a gag beneath that she cannot speak, but its easy enough to read melancholy on her expression.]  She moans lewdly, the hum of powerful vibrators terribly audible.  At least the cage to your other side is unoccupied.

Hooked to the portion of the cage nearest your head are a set of handcuffs, and while your hands would have to be slipped outside the cage to use them the Officer notices your attention and intervenes.

&quot;Those are only if you *want* them,&quot; she grins.  What could that mean?  She doesn&#39;t explain, but instead climbs up onto the flatbed.

Carefully the Officer places your mask beside you, in the cage.]  Reaching to her belt, the Officer then produces something you&#39;re unfortunately familiar with-- a ball gag, along with a full head harness.  With your mouth held open as requested its easy for her to slide the shiny orange ball between your lips, seating it firmly behind your teeth as she works to secure the straps.  One by one they&#39;re tightened until she&#39;s satisfied, finishing the installation with a pair of small padlocks, one on the buckle behind each ear.

With that accomplished she jumps down from the flatbed only to then reach to your cage door, swinging it back into place, and locking it with a third padlock-- this one quite heavy.  

Settling into the small confines of your cage, adjusting to the sensation of your ballgag between your teeth, the Officer however intervenes-- she&#39;s not done yet.  &quot;You will keep your legs spread.&quot;

She speaks of your fate with such serenity you imagine you&#39;re not the first, or anywhere near it, to be told such by Nikaido.  That you&#39;re in good company hardly helps with the prospect of such treatment, torture, and enslavement so clearly on the horizon however, the shock on your face clearly evident as the Officer clears her throat.  Drawing your attention, she leans down, looming over you.

&quot;But I have an offer to make of you...&quot;

[[&quot;What sort of offer...?&quot;-&gt;ArrestEndCount3]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1300" name="ArrestEndCount3" tags="" position="17611,26015" size="100,100">&quot;Temporary parole.

&quot;Find something of interest to us in the few hours we give you, and depending on how good it is I will put in to have your infraction count reduced, and thus your eventual sentence.  And if you do *very* well?  Perhaps we could make use of you further.  The Ministry of Truants largely conscripts our Officers from the inmate population, and while the training and life are not easy... I can personally attest to how quickly your freedom can be earned, if you do the work well.&quot;

*There is, of course, a third possibility.  Complete and total escape from Torei.  You&#39;re not sure how, but given a few borrowed hours of freedom perhaps you could still save yourself... you&#39;re already so close to the Way Up, after all.*

&quot;So, what will it be?&quot;  Officer Nikaido asks, crossing her arms beneath her chest.  &quot;Stay under arrest and go onto the punishment frame, or a few hours parole?&quot;

[[&quot;I&#39;m not helping enslave anyone else.  I don&#39;t care what you do to me.&quot;-&gt;PrisonerEnd]]

Reaching up, she pulls the brim of her cap just a little bit lower as her free hand gestures to the truants suffering nearby.

&quot;You&#39;re *sure* about that?&quot;

[[&quot;Actually... I&#39;ll take the parole.&quot;-&gt;ArrestEnd4]]

Demonstrate you can do more then that, bring me a truant for example, and I&#39;ll even offer you conscription into the Ministry.  You&#39;ll have until the end of my shift-- midnight.&quot;

That doesn&#39;t give you much time, but you hardly expect pity from the Officer at this point.  Stepping forward she does offer a hand to help you from the cage however, although when you go to take it she seizes your wrist instead.

&quot;There is one more thing, before you go.  Know that if you fail me, or if you try to take this opportunity to run, I *will* find you.  And to make sure you don&#39;t get into any trouble...&quot;

She snaps her free hand, a prompt that brings one of her subordinate Officer over-- a fearsome looking device tipped with a needle being given over.

[[&quot;What&#39;s that for...?&quot;-&gt;ArrestEnd5]]
[[Uh oh...-&gt;ArrestEnd5]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1303" name="PrisonerEnd2" tags="" position="17244,26325" size="100,100">&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/C6dzb6k.jpg&quot; width=&quot;30%&quot; height=&quot;30%&quot;&gt;

&quot;Stupid girl,&quot; the Officer spits, before gesturing sharply over her own shoulder as she steps away.  &quot;Rig her up with the others then, if she wants it so badly.&quot;

And they do.  Cutting away your previous garments, they replace them with stark black laminate, an exact match for the tortured rows of other women all around you.  Catsuit and corset, heels and gloves, cuffs and armbinder.  They&#39;re added to your body one by one, stripping you of freedoms as simple as the right to use your own hands-- until the final piece is held before you.  The mask.  Rendered in heavy, thick laminate, you cannot help but think of a similar mask, offered so recently by the Daemon.  But this one you cannot turn down.

Once masked, the only thing left is to rig you to the punishment frame.  Without eyes to see or a mouth to scream, you&#39;re forced into a strict position bent over, your restrained arms held up and above you in a strappado position that quickly proves uncomfortable.  There you are rigged, locked to the frame, but not yet done-- the final instrument of your punishment comes in the form of your dildos, still installed, roaring to life.

&quot;How long for this one?&quot; You can just barely hear the Officer nearest you ask of Nikaido.  The response is immediate.

&quot;(if: $TruantCount is &lt; 5)[The whore didn&#39;t rack up too many infractions.  Give her eight hours, until morning.](if: $TruantCount is 5 or 6 or 7 or 8 or 9)[The whore racked up a considerable number of infractions.  Give her sixteen hours.

I want her begging to cum by the time we release her.]&quot;

You join the quiet chorus of moans, another warning for travelers to beware the dangers of Torean society.  You&#39;re truly lost to the laminate now.

They must be quite practiced in this entire thing as Nikaido approaches boldly, placing her palm up on your head to steady it, then lining up the device she holds.

&quot;Consider this a warning.  I will be pushing your ID to the central Ministry database, marking you as a temporary parolee.  Do not wander far, and do not make me come and find you again.  If you do not contact me I *will* track you down, and then I will utilize this little device to make sure you never run off again.  By piercing your septum, and giving you a nice little tracking ring.  As a *starter.*  Parolees who require forcible detainment again rarely enjoy the consequences.&quot;

She makes no mention of removing the plugs you had been tortured with, and you&#39;re unwilling to push the subject further.  With a sigh you step back, your liberty restored-- by the thinnest of margins, on borrowed time.   
(set: $Wanted to 2)
*Will you try to merely reduce your eventual sentence?  Will you try to impress Nikaido, and earn an invitation into the Ministry?  Or will you risk it all on trying to flee once more?*

For now you move towards the far end of the terminal, boarding one of the shuttles that ran towards the Way Up.  In the shadow of Torei&#39;s singular space elevator your chances would be best, whatever it is you choose to do.

&quot;Prisoner #38511b, this court finds you *guilty.*&quot;

(colour: green)[Inventory cleared!]

The judge reigning over your case delivers the judgement to the quiet disinterest of the court, your fate having been decided upon in the short space of a few hours.  Despite the brevity you&#39;ve been a prisoner of the Ministry of Truants for several months now, and have grown accustomed to the sense of being little more then a number in the system.  Kneeling before the raised dais, your arms are pinned by the bright orange straitjacket that constituted the majority of your Truant&#39;s uniform.  Beneath it you wore a simple black catsuit, while at your throat you&#39;ve grown used to the tight cling of your tall, heavy collar.  Steel hardpoints, two to each side, are often used to afix the poles or leashes so often used upon Truants.

The Judge continues, reading from his docket.  (if: $Servant is true)[&quot;Regarding the circumstances related to  your enslavement by the proprietor of *Club Lush*, this Court finds that contract to be valid, but unorthodox.  Thus you will be given a choice: to either accept the terms of your contract with the Club, and thus enter into slavery upon its premises... or to choose the opportunity for retraining and sale.  In this secondary circumstance, the ownership rights upon your person would be stripped from you, and you would be given training until such time as you can be auctioned by this Ringdom.  You would, however, quite obviously still be a slave, and would be registered as a contract-jumper-- which could influence your opportunities with regards to earning another collar.  Still... the choice is yours.  Speak it now.&quot;

[[&quot;I choose to accept my collar from Club Lush...&quot;-&gt;LushEnd]]
[[&quot;I choose the opportunity to be auctioned.&quot;-&gt;AucEndChoice]]](else:)[&quot;You are hearby condemned by this court to the full penalties of the slave code, as outlined in Articles eight, thirteen, and forty-four.  Your legal rights are hereby striped, and your permanent registration as a slave ordered.  For next six months you will be admitted to a slave-training program, which will culminate in your eventual sale at auction.&quot;

He leans over his dias to meet your gaze.  &quot;Do you have any final words for this court, Prisoner #38511b?&quot;

[[&quot;No, Master.&quot;-&gt;PrisonerEnd4Nice]]
[[&quot;I accept my punishment, Master.&quot;-&gt;PrisonerEnd4Nice]]

Eventually you arrival at a terminal building that promises free shuttles to the Way Up, operating on constant schedule-- this near the beating heart of Torean commerce, such things never slept.  And yet, stepping through the vestibule, its here you get a taste of what failure may have meant for you.

Truants line the walkway before you, each wearing laminate outfits of obvious severity, the punishment frames they&#39;re secured to forcing them into a deeply uncomfortable position.  Without eyes to see, due to their blindfolds, nor mouths to screan-- due to their gags-- they are left to merely endure.  Signs above each meanwhile explain why they were being subjected to such treatment.  Some are common enough crimes, theft for instance, but most seem to have fallen afoul of Torean culture: curfew violations, debtors and the like.

Passing by them as quickly as possible, if only to escape their muffled moans-- of ecstasy or agony you cannot rightly tell apart-- you board one of shuttles making for the way up.

On approach via the shuttle, you pass beyond Aekora&#39;s strict borders-- although your fractured memories allow you to piece back together that this wasn&#39;t unusual.  Many of the Ringdoms near the elevator but not directly abutting it had treaties to allow direct lines like the one you&#39;re riding to the elevator base itself.

That would mean passing through an Aekoran customs checkpoint, the last before entering into the legally distinct area maintained by the Space Elevator authority-- where Torean contracts and slavery no longer applied.  (if: $Wanted is 0)[Having emerged from Club Lush without Truant Officers seeking to detain you, however, you suspect you will recieve little hassle-- at least on that particular front.](if: $Wanted is 1)[Having emerged from Club Lush with Truant Officers seeking to detain you, however, you have to imagine getting through will not be easy-- and being captured would be a horrific fate indeed.](if: $Wanted is 2)[Having emerged from the Truant Officer&#39;s grasp as a registered Truant on parole, however, you have to imagine getting through would be all but impossible-- and being caught in an attempt would induce a fate you cannot even imagine.]  (if: $Slave is true)[Your standardized slave suit presents another potential problem, as the application of certain slave codes while wearing it would undoubtedly lead to your arrest if you attempted to simply walk through.

You would need to find a way out of your locked gear, and a way to clear your status as a slave.]

Still-- as the shuttle pulls into port, you need only look up through the glass ceiling above to see your way off Torei so very close.  Can you make it off planet?

*Do you still want to?*

[[You step from the shuttle.-&gt;CustomsArrive2]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1313" name="CustomsArrive2" tags="" position="18045,26850" size="100,100">The final customs checkpoint looms ahead of you, words painted above the series of exits making that point clear: EXITING SOVEREIGN TOREAN TERRITORY.  Between the long lines there, and your position on the far end of the Aekoran conclave, several other things jump out to you however.

The first is a rather large gathering near the checkpoint, a woman standing atop a decorative planter allowing her to use the voice-amplifier she&#39;s speaking through all the more effectively.  Distance prevents you from hearing everything, but you do recognize a familiar phrase-- *Liberty Society.*  Advocates for women and the enslaved, as well as less distinctly legal ventures.  

It takes a moment, but you finally realize why the crowd seemed so strange to you-- after a full day surrounded by a sea of laminate, this close to the space elevator tourists and offworlders seemingly outnumber the native-born Toreans, making offworld textiles more common.  Instead of blending in, your (if: $Blue is true)[slick blue catsuit](if: $Smoke is true)[slick transparent catsuit](if: $Brand is true)[slick branded catsuit](if: $Sec is true)[slick secretarial laminate](if: $Slave is true)[fully enclosed catsuit](if: $Servant is true)[glossy servant&#39;s attire] now sticks out rather immediately.  In fact, already a few of those passing by stare at you.

Addressing that could be achieved at the banks of Wardrobe machines you see along the side wall, although obviously that would take a few credits.  Still-- to your amazement, you actually see a woman emerge from one wearing a very plain, quite ugly shift-- but it is *not* laminate!

Before you get any further in your slow examination of the customs enclave, however, a hand lands upon your shoulder.

You had glimpsed it earlier, while discussing with Corinth: something that stood out amongst the various small shops and eateries lining the Customs Enclave.  *Celeste Academy*, the sign had read, and picking it out from the crowd you approach it again.  The outer facade is glass, clean and gleaming, that accents well the sparse interior.  Indeed, the room is mostly empty space excepting a small water feature in the center.  Even your battered memory can recall how expensive water rights could be, making it a copious display of wealth.

*Just what was this place?*

As if to answer that, a woman sits patiently before you, running a red gloved hand slowly through the water.  Ripples spread outward in tight little circles.

There several small stores and cafes can be found, in which one of the latter you spot whom you had been looking for.  She&#39;s seated at a small table, dressed in a simply yet elegant black laminate catsuit.  Her particular design has a front zipper, which is pulled down low.

&quot;Prisoner #38511b, this court finds you *guilty.*&quot;

(colour: green)[Inventory cleared!]

The judge reigning over your case delivers the judgement to the quiet disinterest of the court, your fate having been decided upon in the short space of a few hours.  Despite the brevity you&#39;ve been a prisoner of the Ministry of Truants for several months now, and have grown accustomed to the sense of being little more then a number in the system.  Kneeling before the raised dais, your arms are pinned by the bright orange straitjacket that constituted the majority of your Truant&#39;s uniform.  Beneath it you wore a simple black catsuit, while at your throat you&#39;ve grown used to the tight cling of your tall, heavy collar.  Steel hardpoints, two to each side, are often used to afix the poles or leashes so often used upon Truants.

The Judge continues, reading from his docket.  (if: $Servant is true)[&quot;Regarding the circumstances related to  your enslavement by the proprietor of *Club Lush*, this Court finds that contract to be valid, but unorthodox.  Thus you will be given a choice: to either accept the terms of your contract with the Club, and thus enter into slavery upon its premises... or to choose the opportunity for retraining and sale.  In this secondary circumstance, the ownership rights upon your person would be stripped from you, and you would be given training until such time as you can be auctioned by this Ringdom.  You would, however, quite obviously still be a slave, and would be registered as a contract-jumper-- which could influence your opportunities with regards to earning another collar.  Still... the choice is yours.  Speak it now.&quot;

Roughly you&#39;re then raised, a third Officer forcing your mouth open as she shoves an orange ball between your lips.  A harness is then secured around your head, keeping it firmly in place.

You know struggling against a guide pole is nearly impossible, and begin to simmer down as the Officers guide you from the room, undoubtedly back to your cell.  

&quot;I suspect you will take poorly to your collar,&quot; the Judge insists from on high, free to get in the final word now that you&#39;re gagged.  &quot;It matters not, of course.  Breaking slaves is our specialty here, in Aekora.&quot;

Your name upon the small placard set beside the door finally allows your situation to sink in fully, in a way it had not over the past few months.  There, in finely engraved letters, your *cage* is so clearly identified.  Your new home, one among a good dozen or so in the backrooms of Club Lush.

&quot;So the Club is open until dawn, and then we have cleanup,&quot; Cherish explains, standing beside you in a blue uniform that matched your own.  Tight, laminate, with skirts too short to ever truly hide the bright white panties just beneath.  She&#39;s been giving you the tour, and explaining the rules.

&quot;After the Club is cleaned, if you&#39;ve been good you might be allowed to cum.  Or if you&#39;re bad... well, just don&#39;t be that, alright?&quot;

She smiles beside you, hands clasped before her waist.  &quot;It can be hard at times, but Master Kaleb is fair.  He only punishes us if we deserve it.  Are you ready for your first night on the floor?  You&#39;ve been assigned a smaller area, so you can get used to it.&quot;

The *Tourist&#39;s Special* appears to be an attempt to provide the quintessential Torean experience.  Based around a simple black catsuit, accessories are listed as an underbust corset and a set of heeled boots-- the latter being particularly aggressive, with towering platforms.  Complementing makeup is incloded.

The cost is: 50 credits.

The *Dutiful Shopkeeper* is an attempt at providing an all-in-one outfit for those looking to maintain a professional appearance, by Torean standards at least.  Based around a long white pencil skirt and black blouse, the latter includes a significant cleavage window while the former goes below the knee-- restricting the gait considerably.  Accesories are listed as a pair of white laminate gloves, five inch heeled pumps, a high-waisted belt, and complementing makeup.

The cost is 100 credits.

The screen displays a pair of models wearing the selected outfit.  To call it *intense* would be a severe understatement, as the warning that follows makes clear:

*This is a standardized Slave-Rated Wardrobe outfit, as described in the Aekoran Slave Codes, Chapter 812, subsection 10.  Wearing this uniform will subject all Slaves to High Protocol Laws as described in the Aekoran Slave Code, Chapter 679.  Freewombs wearing this uniform will be subjected to portions of the Slave Code, and certain liberties may be revoked.*

Accessories are listed as the pictured corset, heels, regulation mask, posture collar, and (non-pictured) inserts.  The corset is noted as featuring &#39;real steel&#39; boning, and is custom-measured to match standard Torean expectations of functional corsetry.  So too does the posture collar proudly proclaim its core as beein &#39;real steel&#39;, as well as meeting all Aekoran slave law requirements.  The heels are listed as six inches in height, with one inch platforms.  The mask is simply described as rated for Torean storms, as well as regulating oxygen intake.  And the inserts?  Those are described as front and rear installation, custom-molded for maximum stimulation.  All devices feature 10 hour self-release locks.

On one hand it would a terribly strict crash course in Torean culture for the shopkeeper, but on the other... (if: $Slave is true)[you wear the exact same outfit, with all the discomfort-- and pleasure-- that came along with it.]  (if: $CorSlave is true)[And you&#39;ve already graced Corinth with such an outfit, why not spread the joy further?]

She&#39;s wide-eyed.  &quot;That was...&quot; her words cut out as she appears to look down for the first time, noticing her own body.  The black laminate of her catsuit catches the bright lights of the terminal brilliantly, sending waves of glossy reflection along her hips and thighs, breasts and waist.

Immediately her gloved hands move to cover the hole in her blouse, her chest exposed for all to see.  Yet it&#39;s a demonstration of demureness she cannot hold, the desire to skate her hands down her own glossy body too much to resist.

She leans forward as a result, moaning loudly, the movement only furthering the effect.  It leaves her panting afterward, even as her hands move to her mask, trying to pull it off.  The locks she eventually finds makes it clear that isn&#39;t happening soon.

Much like the hotel&#39;s Wardrobe, this one has a drain in the bottom of the unit, its use revealed by the first stage of your re-dressing-- the removal.  Instead of peeling the laminate from your body, a simple solvant is applied by a spraying arm, and in mere moments the material is dripping off your body like so much wet paint.  

Removing your plugs is a different matter-- that requires a pair of arms to seize them directly, but as you squirm in your restraints they&#39;re pulled free from your tortured cunt.  You take a deep breath, the first in some time, as you are no longer masked.  A brief, tantalizing taste of nudity follows... but not for long.  With a fresh whirl, the Wardrobe begins working on your new outfit as a ring descends from above.

Thus your outfit is quiet literally printed on, first applying bright white but transitioning to an equally vibrant shade of red as it passes your waist and forms a stylish pencil skirt.  The ring descending bit by bit, rendering soft flesh into equally soft but so very *different* laminate.  Secondary arms follow it down, providing spot treatment along seams and friction points-- although often the effect is for merely aesthetic purposes.  Sometimes that takes the form of a second application of laminate, other times it lingers to produce something more substantial-- such as the small folded collar just beneath your chin, or the buttons that almost immediately strain to keep your bust constained by your bodice.

You&#39;re given no time to rest as the base layer concludes, the ring rapidly ascending as other arms move into the space to begin work on your accessories.  The peplum skirt you saw pictured is thus formed, starting with the belt at your waist.  Small pre-forged rivets are sunk into the still molton laminate before it is sealed, as is the belt loop that is seated directly over your naval.  Still held in place, small arms flair the laminate that extends over your rear, achieving the look most of the galaxy would label as *slutty* but Torei saw as merely coquettish.

The final componenent of your outfit comes with the sensation of your own feet rising, the sensation unequal and focused primarily at your heel.  Without the restraint arms you would have toppled over, but they hold you tight, tall heels being extruded into place.  More red laminate follows, coating your feet excepting the stylish hole at the very front.

Almost as an afterthought, makeup is applied last.  Mechanical arms seize your head, holding it tight as nozzles approach your face.  A quick blast of air instinctively causes your eyes to close, and in that brief moment the Wardrobe does its work.  Your eyelids have been darkened, a crimson secondary coat added that flashed only when light slid across it.  Pores and blemishes have been rendered impotent as well, while your cheekbones have been highlighted.  And your lips are now a poignant, inviting red.

Now-- there are two particular services I offer, *shipment* and a *key*, alongside a third... let us call it a *special offer.*  If you would like to discuss such things, or anything else just let me know.

Let us say you seek to leave Torei, but you cannot pass through customs.  Why?  I hardly care.  But you must, and I can provide, no questions asked.  For the low cost of 450 credits you will be packaged as slaves so frequently are, for delivery.  And that is how your crate will be marked.  But upon shipment your crate will be... lost, only to be found on the far side of the border, where Torean laws no longer apply.  There you will be freed, given a new ticket for the Way Up, and our business will conclude.&quot;

Holding it up before you, small letters appear emblazoned upon it:

*International Port Authority*

&quot;Between this terminal and the international zone is the customs checkpoint, of course, but to either side are open gardens to which I can provide access, and a copy of this keycard-- which will get you into the otherwise securely locked door on the far side of said garden.  All for the low cost of 100 credits.&quot;

She twists her wrist sharply, sliding the card back down and out of the way.  &quot;I recommend my shipping services over this, however, because the garden itself is guarded, and we have never attempted this as of yet.  You would be required to reach the far side of your own accord, and I do hate providing a service I cannot guarantee.  Still-- outrun or outsmart the guards, make it through that door, and they will not be able to touch you.  Fail...&quot;

She shrugs her shoulders, as if that could speak for itself.

You keep this in mind, to discuss with Corinth later.

On average you would be within the crate... for perhaps a week?  Maybe more.  Given you&#39;re packaged in the same manner as an actual slave enduring long-distance shipment, you will of course be provided with nutrition.  Torean slave slurry tastes quite horrid, I&#39;ve been told, but it will keep you fed and watered.&quot;

*One to two weeks!*

But you wouldn&#39;t be discussing this if you had better options, I imagine.&quot;

She leans back.  &quot;To assuage your fears however... I will say that a particular Society works with me, using my services to help slaves... *travel.*  If I am good enough for them, I should be good enough for you.&quot;

Well-- if this is truly your desire, you need only say the word.  But be warned, you will be taken for shipment preparation immediately, so if there is anything else you wish to do in Aekora, you best do it now.&quot;

(if: $CorSlave is true and $CorStat is 5)[This would mean leaving Corinth behind, almost certainly dooming her to eventual slavery.]

Then she waits, patiently, until the requisite credits are indeed drained from your account.  Once it does, you&#39;re treated to perhaps Anastasia&#39;s first pleased expression-- although quickly it turns predatory.  She leans over table, one hand upon it. 

&quot;We will begin prepping you for shipment immediately.  All you *need* to do is tell the woman at the counter you want &#39;the slave&#39;s special.&#39;&quot;

Turning your head, you look across the small cafe to where the cafe&#39;s attendent is slowly cleaning out a teacup.  She looks bored.

[[&quot;Okay, I can do that.&quot;-&gt;SmugShip4]]

Without anything left to do you stand, making your way over to the counter as indicated.

&quot;What will it be, ma&#39;am?&quot;  The attendant asks.

To the unasked question the &#39;travel agent&#39; nods, and that seems like all the attendent needs.

&quot;Well then,&quot; she lifts the portion of the counter that allowed access to the area behind it.  &quot;Follow me.&quot;

Without waiting for you, she disappears into the backroom.

[[You&#39;re committed now.  Follow her!-&gt;SmugShip6]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1456" name="SmugShip6" tags="" position="9640,31296" size="100,100">The backroom is not large, primarily reserved for the storage of the cafe&#39;s various supplies, but against the far wall there is something unexpected-- a pair of wardrobe devices.  They appear a bit... bootleg, mounted on a rolling cart and being smaller then the official ones you&#39;ve used thus far.  Beside them are a series of crates, in differing shapes and sizes.

Picking up a glassboard hanging from the side of the wardrobe, the attendant flicks through several pages.  &quot;Hmmm... ah, lucky you.  Next scheduled pickup is for a trained fuckdoll slave.  Academy-certified and everything.  That means... the violet outfit...&quot;

She taps upon the Wardrobe&#39;s control panel.  &quot;...boots... makeup... gag... there!&quot;

Turning to you, she uses the glassboard to gesture towards the maw of the waiting Wardrobe.  &quot;Well?  In ya go.&quot;

[[&quot;Wait-- what kind of slave?&quot;-&gt;SmugShip7Ex]]

Oh!&quot;  The attendent looks to you, then raps the nearest crate with the back of her hand.  &quot;We use different boxes, different claims of what sort of slaves are being shipped-- anything to throw off the Ministry.  You&#39;re going in as an Academy fuckdoll, a slave who has been trained as a very dutiful sort of concubine.  But that&#39;s just your cover, of course!  All you need to do is look the part.&quot;

She repeats the gesture towards the Wardrobe.  &quot;So... in ya go!&quot;

Usually the people who do this *need* to leave, don&#39;t you?  To get into the international zone?  Well this is the way it&#39;s going to happen.  So... get in there.&quot;

Seizing hold of you they begin the systematic removal of your current oufit, but abstain from the (perhaps expensive) solvents used by other machines.  Instead your laminate is simply cut off, the sensation of sharp shears running so near your skin quite disconcerting.  Yet it achieves its goal without cutting you, leaving you momentarily stripped to your bare skin.

(colour: green)[Inventory Cleared!]

Above you the halo-like device that mounted the printing armatures descends, and your new gear is built in place upon you.  It starts with a Torean classic, the catsuit, this one in a purple shade that quickly proves to be semi-transparent.  Black is then chosen for your accessories, which are formed more slowly.  At your feet ballet heels are extruded and then connected to knee high boots, while at your waist an underbust corset is installed, then tightened cruelly by the Wardrobe itself.  

Afterward your arms are pulled back and layers of laminate applied upon them, linking them together in a single-sleeve armbinder that both prevents any usage of your arms *and* proves decidedly uncomfortable in mere moments.  Progressing further up a posture collar, also in black, is printed for around your throat.  With it in place, running firmly from jaw to collarbone, you cannot turn your head nor look down.  Makeup follows, violet lipstick being applied to your lips, eyeliner and blush accompanying-- while large fake eyelashes ensure a permanently sultry look.

The final component is a gag, a large black ball being seated behind your teeth as straps are printed to hold it firmly in place by snapping into place behind your head.  Annoyingly, a tube seems to emerge from the back of the ball, tickling your throat slightly.  Only then does the Wardrobe release you back out into the backroom.

Noticing your emergence, the attendant looks to you with a smile, standing over a long crate now laying upon the floor, the pink foam within holding a distinctly feminine silhouette.

&quot;Look at you,&quot; she muses, settling her hands on your corseted waist.  &quot;You&#39;re just a feminine little doll now, hm?&quot;

Brushing a bit of your own hair from your eyes, she glides her hands up the violet laminate of your chest.  It&#39;s a simple tease, and one she doesn&#39;t linger on before turning to present you to the box upon the floor.

&quot;Now, be a good doll and move up beside your box.  Printed the foam insert to your exact measurements, while you were inside the Wardrobe.  Should be nice and comfy... for awhile, at least.&quot;

The foam padding beneath you is indeed rather comfortable, even providing a perfectly shaped indent for your bound arms.  What&#39;s decidedly less comfortable is the lead she connects to the front of your ballgag, the tube positioned down your throat now serving a clear purpose, as she loads a small jug of some sort of liquid into the box beside your head.  Food.

Further restraints follow, black straps anchored in the box emerging to snap tightly across your body at ankle, hips, waist, and throat.

&quot;There--&quot; the attendent concludes, placing two more items in the insets apparently designed just for them.  &quot;Accessories... extra gag, and a vibrating wand.  Done!  One counterfeit Academy-grade fuckdoll, all pretty and packed up.  You just need your lid, and you&#39;re lucky, dolls get a *view.*&quot;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/LHncakj.jpg&quot; width=&quot;30%&quot; height=&quot;30%&quot;&gt;

To demonstrate she holds up the lid for your box, which indeed does have a clear panel that would expose you from waist to head.  The pink graphics and label mark the contents as *Fuckdoll Slave*, *A Fully Trained Torean Doll*, and *A Product of Celeste Academy*.

Unable to move, there is little you can do as the lid slotted into place upon your box, then secured with several heavy locks.

Longer route.  Well-- enjoy your time as a doll, you&#39;re looking at perhaps two weeks of it.&quot;

Tapping your crate, she turns back to return to the cafe&#39;s front.

They very much look the part of basic labor and act like it, working together to lift your box.  The restraints and foam work cooperatively to limit your jostling, and if your toes weren&#39;t so strictly pointed and your arms not bent back it would have almost been comfortable.

Instead of taking you back through the cafe they carry your display box through some manner of backend tunnel before eventually spilling out onto a public thoroughfare, where a flatbed truck awaits.  There you&#39;re loaded alongside a variety of other packages and crates, little more then property being moved from one place to another.  Placed on your back looking up towards the sky, you&#39;re given your first (at least that you could recall) view of the Way Up stretching towards the heavens through the window of your box.  You&#39;re *so* close, and yet in laminate and restraints, boxed like a perfect little doll, you might as well be a thousand miles away.  

Slowly it starts to recede as the delivery truck moves.

[[One of the porters appears above you.-&gt;SmugShip13]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1466" name="SmugShip13" tags="" position="9720,32490" size="100,100">&quot;You know the worst part, Arnst?&quot; He asks to his partner, presumably driving the truck up front.  &quot;When they make us haul one of these girls who are worth more then we make in a *year*, you know?&quot;

The other man, presumably Arnst, seems to suggest a shrug by tone alone.  &quot;Don&#39;t kick yourself about it, everyone knows those Academy fuck dolls are overpriced.&quot;

The man above you meets your eyes through the clear portion of your box.  &quot;I don&#39;t know, I heard they&#39;re pretty well trained.&quot;

You may have been staring at him, but he seems content to treat you as almost inanimate.

Eventually you&#39;re offloaded from the truck, entering a processing center of some sort.  You catch the glimpse of the occasional collared slave peeking into your display box, but most simply seem focused on their work-- and soon you&#39;re being loaded into the baggage compartment of a train.

That&#39;s even worse, the barest hint of interesting locales replaced by a darkened interior.  Sometime later, you think its night, you finally work up the courage to suckle on the tube hanging from your gag-- and are rewarded with a foul slurry that runs down your throat.  Apparently the food of slaves, but all you can attest to is that it&#39;s thankfully filling.  You don&#39;t need to eat much.

And thus a cycle developes, your drifting into fitful sleep only to be awakened by the rattle of the train.  When hungry you suck out some more of the nutriant slurry.

That you&#39;re awake becomes clear as you feel the ache in your arms and legs, a telltale sign soon replaced by blinding *light.*

&quot;Transit number... yeah, there it is,&quot; a female voice declares, just before hands settle upon your box.  You&#39;re pulled out into the blinding light of day, although thankfully you&#39;re propped up against the side of the train instead of staring up directly into that burning sun.

You&#39;re on a train platform of some sort, rolling fields of green stretching out across the horizon.  Before you stands something downright terrifying, however-- a pair of Truant Officers.

*Has the plan come apart?  You can&#39;t even run!*

&quot;Be careful,&quot; one Officer admonishes the other, adjusting her cap.  &quot;Don&#39;t scratch that box, you know what our orders say.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, yeah,&quot; the shorter one replies, standing back up as they work together to remove your lid.  After a week, the fresh air that enters is heavenly-- and feels nearly as good as your fears of discovery being quickly squashed.

&quot;Pull the box, affix a new label, change the tracker inside,&quot; the Officer continues, as if speaking a carefully prepared script.  &quot;We&#39;ve done this a hundred times, stop worrying.&quot;

&quot;I *always* worry with these dolls,&quot; the partner responds.  &quot;Most of these jobs are just cheap auction trash, but only the rich would own one of these slaves.  Imagine messing that up.&quot;

The bolder one rolls her eyes, then reaches down, plucking the vibrator wand in your box-- listed as an included accessory-- out from its slot.  Her other hand settles on your hip, the smooth curve emphasized by the corset still embracing you so tightly.

They appear a bit... bootleg, mounted on a rolling cart and being smaller then the official ones you&#39;ve used thus far.  Beside them are a series of crates, in differing shapes and sizes.

Your guiding attendant ignores them completely however, instead moving towards an otherwise nondescript wall.  When she presses upon one of the durasteel bricks, however, it shifts-- revealing a hidden door, and a tunnel burrowed into it.

Producing a keycard, she offers it to you.  &quot;Go down the hallway, fourth door-- only one on your right.  The others won&#39;t open, so don&#39;t try it.&quot;

A spotlight suddenly ignites, hellishly bright in comparison, from the rooftop of the Terminal you now stand ready to exit.

Still-- you see your goal in the distance, a door that would have been too dark to make out had it not been for the red light blinking above it.  You&#39;re so close-- and the way is remarkably clear, an empty expanse of grass before you.

Either way you avoid them, but about halfway across another peril befalls you-- a searchlight arcing across the grass, then along the wall you&#39;re moving across.  It will reach you any moment.

It takes your eyes a good minute to regain vision, but by then you already know you&#39;re in trouble.  You had fallen, unable to get up-- the *why* explained when you can finally look down, revealing the thick laminate straps that have wrapped around your body.

Rising, the black-suited smuggler gestures for you to follow across the small cafe.  Approaching the counter, the attendant rushes to lift the portion that allowed access behind-- clearly a subordinate of some sort.

Opening the door that led to the cafe&#39;s backroom, she never even glances back before entering.  In her wake you hesitate, until the attendant gestures for you to proceed.

Slowly you slide down, now breathing deeply, panting even, as your hands seem to work of their own accord--- one finding your own breast, the other sliding down between your legs.

Before you one of the canisters burns out, the pink mist now filling the courtyard.  Just what was in that?

&quot;Prisoner #38511b, this court finds you *guilty.*&quot;

(colour: green)[Inventory cleared!]

The judge reigning over your case delivers the judgement to the quiet disinterest of the court, your fate having been decided upon in the short space of a few hours.  Despite the brevity you&#39;ve been a prisoner of the Ministry of Truants for several months now, and have grown accustomed to the sense of being little more then a number in the system.  Kneeling before the raised dais, your arms are pinned by the bright orange straitjacket that constituted the majority of your Truant&#39;s uniform.  Beneath it you wore a simple black catsuit, while at your throat you&#39;ve grown used to the tight cling of your tall, heavy collar.  Steel hardpoints, two to each side, are often used to afix the poles or leashes so often used upon Truants.

The Judge continues, reading from his docket.  (if: $Servant is true)[&quot;Regarding the circumstances related to  your enslavement by the proprietor of *Club Lush*, this Court finds that contract to be valid, but unorthodox.  Thus you will be given a choice: to either accept the terms of your contract with the Club, and thus enter into slavery upon its premises... or to choose the opportunity for retraining and sale.  In this secondary circumstance, the ownership rights upon your person would be stripped from you, and you would be given training until such time as you can be auctioned by this Ringdom.  You would, however, quite obviously still be a slave, and would be registered as a contract-jumper-- which could influence your opportunities with regards to earning another collar.  Still... the choice is yours.  Speak it now.&quot;

Everything else bleeds into the backround as you wrestle with that, though: you&#39;re *free*.  You&#39;ve made it!  Despite everything Torei has thrown at you, from the hotel to the streets to the club, you&#39;ve come out on the other side-- encased in glossy laminate, but *free.*

The outfit they eventually provide is not particularly flashy, but it is about as far from your laminate uniform as could be managed.  Freed from so much glossy material, you return to a state of dignity, the Officers leading you out and releasing you to your promised ticket and the Way Up.

Several are very clearly trying to not stare at your laminated form, so tightly sealed, corseted and masked.  Yet they hardly seem ready to argue the point either, your liberty here at least still very much maintained-- even if you chose not to seek *dignity.*

Leading you out to the international concourse, the final Officer gestures that you&#39;re truly free to go-- and the Way Up looms above.

When you raise your masked head you find him blushing fiercely, looking away, but you hardly need his acceptance-- that you had submitted would need to be enough.

Stepping away, your high heeled boots snap upon the tiled floor with each step.

[[Good girl.-&gt;SlaveEscapeEnd]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1517" name="SmugSpecial5" tags="" position="11572,31227" size="100,100">The backroom is not large, primarily reserved for the storage of the cafe&#39;s various supplies, but against the far wall there is something unexpected-- a pair of wardrobe devices.  They appear a bit... bootleg, mounted on a rolling cart and being smaller then the official ones you&#39;ve used thus far.  Beside them are a series of crates, in differing shapes and sizes.

Anastasia already has one of the Wardrobes open, its cramped interior waiting expectantly for you to enter.

&quot;Well?&quot;  She asks, from her position alongside the control panel.  &quot;Get in.  I want you in that cage before the Ministry shift change.&quot;

[[&quot;...alright.&quot;-&gt;SmugSpecial6]]

Seizing hold of you they begin the systematic removal of your current oufit, but abstain from the (perhaps expensive) solvents used by other machines.  Instead your laminate is simply cut off, the sensation of sharp shears running so near your skin quite disconcerting.  Yet it achieves its goal without cutting you, leaving you momentarily stripped to your bare skin.

Above you the halo-like device that mounted the printing armatures descends, and your new gear is built in place upon you.  It starts with a Torean classic, the catsuit, this one covering your head but leaving holes at eyes, nose, and mouth-- and being utterly transparent.  Atop it a second layer, this one white, is added to your head and torso.  At your hips it runs down between your legs, adding a second zipper over your womanhood, but the cut is flared so as to expose more of your hips.  Then your arms are forced to cross beneath your chest, heavy laminate bands securing them there-- and forming a straitjacket that would make you utterly helpless.  

Accessories follow in the form of black ballet boots, ensuring you could hardly walk much less run, a hobble chain between your ankles as if to further that proposition, and a thick black collar at your throat.  Only as an afterthought does it seem to add a pair of laminate pieces to your dual-layered hood, one sliding a laminate ring behind your teeth, forcing your mouth into an &#39;O&#39;, before covering your lips, the second clearly intended to serve as a blindfold-- although this hangs loosely to the side of your head for the time being.

Most of the arms retreat afterward, but one remains to stencil a final pair of labels upon your straitjacket: above your left breast the cryptic **#R55**, and on your back in especially bold letters: 

**Slave Detainee**
**Ministry of Truants**

Anastasia waits without as you emerge, taking careful, measured steps upon your new heels as the hobble limits your range severely.  With your arms bound you&#39;re incapable of fending her off as she approaches sharply, a hand upon your shoulder guiding you in a short half-circle turn.

&quot;Very good, very good, the facsimile appears quite successful... excepting two more accesories.&quot;  Her own boot slides between yours, tapping lightly on the interior of your left foot.

&quot;Bend over, now.  Legs spread, as far as the hobble will allow.&quot;

The Truant Officers certainly won&#39;t go easy on you, they will think you a slave.&quot;

She takes advantage of your bondage to prove her point, seizing you from behind with one arm around your waist before she kicks out your legs-- forcing them as far apart as the hobble would allow.  She follows that with a hand at the back of your collared throat, pushing you down, bending you over.

&quot;Was that so hard?&quot;

[[&quot;Mmmmh...&quot;-&gt;SmugSpecial8]]

Now... let&#39;s open you up and get these installed.&quot;

Just what that meant is revealed by the sensation of her hand between your legs, nimble fingers landing upon the zipper of your leotard-like straitjacket.  Pulling it open she repeats the process with your catsuit, revealing your womanhood.  Defenseless and exposed, there is little you can do in self-defense as she slides a pair of thin laminate devices into your holes, front and rear.  Afterward she zips you back up, but a pair of tubes now hang between your legs, each ending in a small laminate ball.

You&#39;re hardly given a chance to acclimate to the sense of being filled before Anastasia reaches between your legs again, pumping one of the balls several times.  Within your cunt you feel the narrow dildo there begin to expand, inflating with each squeeze of the smuggler&#39;s palm.

[[&quot;Mmmmmghhh!&quot;-&gt;SmugSpecial9]]

Crossing the room, she approaches an empty space of wall, then presses her hand against one of the bricks there-- revealing a hidden door that unfolds itself, a tunnel leading into darkness.  Stepping in, Anastasia again doesn&#39;t look back.

&quot;Come on now, R55.&quot;

[[It&#39;s not like you have a choice.-&gt;SmugSpecial10]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1523" name="SmugSpecial10" tags="" position="11603,31998" size="100,100">The smuggler&#39;s door closes behind you, momentarily casting the tunnel into darkness-- until your eyes adjust to the gloom, revealing small lights set into the floor.  Anastasia is already walking ahead and you struggle to catch up, wary of tripping in your heels without arms to catch yourself.

Passing one door, and then another, she eventually comes to a stop at the third on your left-- although you see one more further up, to the right.  What lay beyond *that* portal you&#39;ll never know, as Anastasia instead opens the one before you.

A Truant Officer nearly jumps out of her uniform in response to your sudden entrance, but calms upon seeing Anastasia-- only to startle again when her eyes land upon you.

&quot;You didn&#39;t even warn me!&quot;  She complains, a hand at her chest.  Anastasia is unimpressed.

&quot;This proved to be a quickly developing opportunity.  Now-- open the cage for me, will you Valroux?&quot;

The cage in question is just behind her, rather large and all but empty, except for a familiar looking woman in white laminate...

&quot;Hello again, Sister,&quot; Anastasia greets, your inability to speak preventing any attempt at clarifying just what *that* meant.  Either way, the actual switch is thus easily accomplished-- the mystery slave is led out on a leash, clearly trying to speak through her gag, while you are in turn led into the cage, where Officer Valroux locks it behind you.

Anastasia is already making for her tunnel, slave in tow, without even biding you goodbye.  Valroux watches her go, waiting for the tunnel entrance to seal-- blending in with the wall in the same manner you had observed earlier-- before turning to you.

&quot;Look-- I don&#39;t know who you are, and I don&#39;t really care.  Detainees are inspected at dawn and dusk, each day.  Feedings at noon.  Don&#39;t screw this up-- just keep quiet, be the submissive slave everyone expects you to be.  Got it?&quot;

Several squeezes later, the phallic intruders bulging within you, they withdraw-- but not before securing your blindfold in place across your eyes.

&quot;Gotta watch Valroux,&quot; one Officer tells the other, as they retreat.  &quot;She&#39;s getting soft.  Protocol demands R55 be kept gagged and blindfolded, unless being transported-- so make sure it gets done with every inspection.&quot;

The other Officer doesn&#39;t reply, perhaps nodding although your blindfold denies you that fact.  With a final squeeze of your inflatable they retreat, leaving you to your cage.

She smiles.  &quot;Celeste Acadamy is the alternative.  If the chances are high that you&#39;re about to be collared, you&#39;re already destined to enroll with us-- Celeste Academy holds an exclusive contract with the local branch of the Ministry of Truants.

We cannot guarantee just *what* sort of slave you will eventually become, that depends on the effort you put into your training, but you will graduate at the end to the auction block.&quot;

She sounds almost proud.  &quot;Voluntary enrollments generally translate to higher valuation at the end, an important consideration.  Inexpensive slaves, who often come to us from the Ministry of Truants, often end up serving in very... menial roles.

[[&quot;Okay, I can do that.&quot;-&gt;CorShip4]]
[[&quot;That&#39;s it?&quot;-&gt;CorShip4]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1587" name="CorShip4" tags="" position="9308,31005" size="100,100">Anastasia nods, then leans back with her teacup, pointedly dismissing both you and Corinth with her sudden disinterest.  Without anything left to do you stand, making your way over to the counter as indicated.

&quot;Oh... I did not like her,&quot; your friend attempts to whisper, although her regulation mask makes that difficult.  She lapses back into silence as you step up to the counter.

&quot;What will it be, ma&#39;am?&quot;  The attendant asks.

[[&quot;The... slave&#39;s special?&quot;-&gt;CorShip5]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1588" name="CorShip5" tags="" position="9308,31155" size="100,100">The attendent perks up at that, looking over your shoulder to where Anastasia remains seated.  To the unasked question the &#39;travel agent&#39; nods, and that seems like all the attendent needs.

&quot;Well then,&quot; she lifts the portion of the counter that allowed access to the area behind it.  &quot;Follow me.&quot;

Without waiting for you, she disappears into the backroom.  As you hesistate Corinth steps forward, the black glossy of her laminate rear the last thing you see before she too disappears.

[[You&#39;re committed now.  Follow her!-&gt;CorShip6]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1589" name="CorShip6" tags="" position="9308,31305" size="100,100">The backroom is not large, primarily reserved for the storage of the cafe&#39;s various supplies, but against the far wall there is something unexpected-- a pair of wardrobe devices.  They appear a bit... bootleg, mounted on a rolling cart and being smaller then the official ones you&#39;ve used thus far.  Beside them are a series of crates, in differing shapes and sizes.

Picking up a glassboard hanging from the side of the wardrobe, the attendant flicks through several pages.  &quot;Hmmm... ah, you girls are lucky indeed.  Next scheduled pickup is for a pair of fully Academy trained and certified fuckdoll slaves.  That means... the violet outfit...&quot;

She taps upon the Wardrobe&#39;s control panel.  &quot;...boots... makeup... gag... there!&quot;

Turning to you, she uses the glassboard to gesture towards the maw of the waiting Wardrobe.  &quot;Well?  In ya go.&quot;

[[&quot;Wait-- what kind of slave?&quot;-&gt;CorShip7Ex]]
[[&quot;I&#39;m not going in there!&quot;-&gt;CorShip7Resist]]

Oh!&quot;  The attendent looks to you, then raps the nearest crate with the back of her hand.  &quot;We use different boxes, different claims of what sort of slaves are being shipped-- anything to throw off the Ministry.  You&#39;re going in as an Academy fuckdoll, a slave who has been trained as a very dutiful sort of concubine.  But that&#39;s just your cover, of course!  All you need to do is look the part.&quot;

She repeats the gesture towards the Wardrobe.  &quot;So... in ya go!&quot;

[[&quot;I&#39;m not going in there!&quot;-&gt;CorShip7Resist]]
[[&quot;Right... okay.&quot;-&gt;CorShip7]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1591" name="CorShip7Resist" tags="" position="9405,31452" size="100,100">The attendent frowns a bit.  &quot;It&#39;s... a bit late for that.  Usually the people who do this *need* to leave, don&#39;t you?  To get into the international zone?  Well this is the way it&#39;s going to happen.  So... get in there.&quot;

Corinth is already approaching her own Wardrobe.  &quot;Come on,&quot; she indicates the machine next to her.  &quot;We can *totally* do this.&quot;

[[&quot;Wait-- what kind of slave?&quot;-&gt;CorShip7Ex]]
[[&quot;Right... okay.&quot;-&gt;CorShip7]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1592" name="CorShip7" tags="" position="9280,31589" size="100,100">With a last hesitant look towards Corinth, you both step into the makeship Wardrobes at the same time-- and your machine responds as you had perhaps expected, with a plethora of arms.  Seizing hold of you they begin the systematic removal of your current oufit, but abstain from the (perhaps expensive) solvents used by other machines.  Instead your laminate is simply cut off, the sensation of sharp shears running so near your skin quite disconcerting.  Yet it achieves its goal without cutting you, leaving you momentarily stripped to your bare skin.

(colour: green)[Inventory Cleared!]

Above you the halo-like device that mounted the printing armatures descends, and your new gear is built in place upon you.  It starts with a Torean classic, the catsuit, this one in a purple shade that quickly proves to be semi-transparent.  Black is then chosen for your accessories, which are formed more slowly.  At your feet ballet heels are extruded and then connected to knee high boots, while at your waist an underbust corset is installed, then tightened cruelly by the Wardrobe itself.  

Afterward your arms are pulled back and layers of laminate applied upon them, linking them together in a single-sleeve armbinder that both prevents any usage of your arms *and* proves decidedly uncomfortable in mere moments.  Progressing further up a posture collar, also in black, is printed for around your throat.  With it in place, running firmly from jaw to collarbone, you cannot turn your head nor look down.  Makeup follows, violet lipstick being applied to your lips, eyeliner and blush accompanying-- while large fake eyelashes ensure a permanently sultry look.

The final component is a gag, a large black ball being seated behind your teeth as straps are printed to hold it firmly in place by snapping into place behind your head.  Annoyingly, a tube seems to emerge from the back of the ball, tickling your throat slightly.  Only then does the Wardrobe release you back out into the backroom.

Yet if you&#39;re fighting your new outfit, at your side Corinth emerges, her inexperience leading to a far greater degree of trouble.  Her uniform is an exact copy of your own, semi-transparent violet catsuit, corset and heels in black, down to the blonde hair that now runs down to her shoulders-- her own auburn locks having apparently been dyed.

Noticing your emergence, the attendant looks to you with a smile, standing over a pair of long crates now laying upon the floor, the pink foam within holding a distinctly feminine silhouette.

&quot;Look at you two,&quot; she muses, as Corinth wriggles impotently beside you.  &quot;A matching set of feminine little dolls now, hm?&quot;

Brushing a bit of your own hair from your eyes, she glides her hands up the violet laminate of your chest.  It&#39;s a simple tease, and one she doesn&#39;t linger on before turning to present you to the box upon the floor.

&quot;Now, be good dolls and move up beside your boxes.  Printed the foam inserts to your exact measurements, while you were inside the Wardrobe.  Should be nice and comfy... for awhile, at least.&quot;

[[&quot;Mmmmggh?&quot;-&gt;CorShip10a]]

The foam padding beneath you is indeed rather comfortable, even providing a perfectly shaped indent for your bound arms.  What&#39;s decidedly less comfortable is the lead she connects to the front of your ballgag, the tube positioned down your throat now serving a clear purpose, as she loads a small jug of some sort of liquid into the box beside your head.  Food.

Further restraints follow, black straps anchored in the box emerging to snap tightly across your body at ankle, hips, waist, and throat-- all of which Corinth watches wide-eyed, her hips shimmying back and forth.  Was this whole predicament... turning her on?

&quot;There--&quot; the attendent concludes, placing two more items in the insets apparently designed just for them.  &quot;Accessories... extra gag, and a vibrating wand.  Done!  One counterfeit Academy-grade fuckdoll, all pretty and packed up.  You just need your lid, and you&#39;re lucky, dolls get a *view.*&quot;

&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/LHncakj.jpg&quot; width=&quot;30%&quot; height=&quot;30%&quot;&gt;

To demonstrate she holds up the lid for your box, which indeed does have a clear panel that would expose you from waist to head.  The pink graphics and label mark the contents as *Fuckdoll Slave*, *A Fully Trained Torean Doll*, and *A Product of Celeste Academy*.

Unable to move, there is little you can do as the lid slotted into place upon your box, then secured with several heavy locks.  Corinth is led to her own box moments later, disappearing from view, although you can see the attendent eventually sliding her lid firmly down.

Longer route.  Well-- enjoy your time as dolls, girls, you&#39;re looking at perhaps two weeks of it.&quot;

Tapping your crate, she turns back to return to the cafe&#39;s front.

[[&quot;Mmmmmghh!&quot;-&gt;CorShip12]]
[[Remain silent.  It&#39;s no use.&quot;-&gt;CorShip12]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1598" name="CorShip12" tags="" position="9357,32338" size="100,100">Somewhere to your side Corinth moans lewdly, but it achieves little.

As promised, they come for you in the morning-- two men, wearing simple laminate overalls.  They very much look the part of basic labor and act like it, working together to lift your box.  The restraints and foam work cooperatively to limit your jostling, and if your toes weren&#39;t so strictly pointed and your arms not bent back it would have almost been comfortable.

Instead of taking you back through the cafe they carry your display box through some manner of backend tunnel before eventually spilling out onto a public thoroughfare, where a flatbed truck awaits.  There you&#39;re loaded alongside a variety of other packages and crates, little more then property being moved from one place to another.  Placed on your back looking up towards the sky, you&#39;re given your first (at least that you could recall) view of the Way Up stretching towards the heavens through the window of your box.  You&#39;re *so* close, and yet in laminate and restraints, boxed like a perfect little doll, you might as well be a thousand miles away.  

Corinth&#39;s box is retrieved afterward, her quiet moans audible as the men eventually set her down on the higher stack of boxes, tilted sideways to fit-- and allowing you to momentarily meet your fellow faux-doll&#39;s eyes.

[[One of the porters appears above you.-&gt;CorShip13]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1599" name="CorShip13" tags="" position="9357,32488" size="100,100">&quot;You know the worst part, Arnst?&quot; He asks to his partner, presumably driving the truck up front.  &quot;When they make us haul one of these girls who are worth more then we make in a *year*, you know?&quot;

The other man, presumably Arnst, seems to suggest a shrug by tone alone.  &quot;Don&#39;t kick yourself about it, everyone knows those Academy fuck dolls are overpriced.&quot;

The man above you meets your eyes through the clear portion of your box.  &quot;I don&#39;t know, I heard they&#39;re pretty well trained.&quot;

You may have been staring at him, but he seems content to treat you as almost inanimate.

Your bondage prevents much movement, but your chest is thrust up a bit for his pleasure.  Corinth follows your lead, pulling against her bondage to do much the same.  The man catches the sound and movement, a hand coming to his chin, as if in thought.

&quot;Slutty little things...&quot;

Arnst, up front, calls again.  &quot;You better stop fantasizing about owning those girls, and get back to work.  Certainly you won&#39;t see them again, did you see that manifest?  They&#39;re going far out into the Antipodes.&quot;

Corinth, without even a view of the sky to pass her time, appears to lapse into a blank-eyed submissive state.  Eventually you both are offloaded from the truck, entering a processing center of some sort.  You catch the glimpse of the occasional collared slave peeking into your display box, but most simply seem focused on their work-- and soon you&#39;re being loaded into the baggage compartment of a train.  That&#39;s even worse, the barest hint of interesting locales replaced by a darkened interior.  That Corinth remains nearby is only evidenced by the wet little moan she gives upon her box being placed nearby.

Sometime later, you think its night, you finally work up the courage to suckle on the tube hanging from your gag-- and are rewarded with a foul slurry that runs down your throat.  Apparently the food of slaves, but all you can attest to is that it&#39;s thankfully filling.  You don&#39;t need to eat much.

And thus a cycle developes, your drifting into fitful sleep only to be awakened by the rattle of the train.  When hungry you suck out some more of the nutriant slurry.

It&#39;s been getting hard to tell the difference between the waking reality of your dark compartment and your sleep that seems filled with much the same.  That you&#39;re awake becomes clear as you feel the ache in your arms and legs, a telltale sign soon replaced by blinding *light.*

&quot;Transit number... yeah, there they are,&quot; a female voice declares, just before hands settle upon your box.  You&#39;re pulled out into the blinding light of day, although thankfully you&#39;re propped up against the side of the train instead of staring up directly into that burning sun.  Corinth&#39;s box follows, her brows upturning slightly as she is carried past before being leaned up beside you.

You&#39;re on a train platform of some sort, rolling fields of green stretching out across the horizon.  Before you stands something downright terrifying, however-- a pair of Truant Officers.

*Has the plan come apart?  You can&#39;t even run!*

&quot;Be careful,&quot; the Officer working upon Corinth&#39;s box admonishes the one working on yours, adjusting her cap.  &quot;Don&#39;t scratch that box, you know what our orders say.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, yeah,&quot; the shorter one replies, standing back up as they remove both lids in unison.  After a week, the fresh air that enters is heavenly-- and feels nearly as good as your fears of discovery being quickly squashed.

&quot;Pull the boxes, affix a new label, change the trackers inside,&quot; the Officer continues, as if speaking a carefully prepared script.  &quot;We&#39;ve done this a hundred times, stop worrying.&quot;

&quot;I *always* worry with these dolls,&quot; the partner responds.  &quot;Most of these jobs are just cheap auction trash, but only the rich would own one of these slaves.  Imagine messing that up.&quot;

The bolder one rolls her eyes, then reaches down, plucking the vibrator wand in your box-- listed as an included accessory-- out from its slot.  Her other hand settles on your hip, the smooth curve emphasized by the corset still embracing you so tightly.

&quot;Stop.  Worrying!&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; he returns to your side, a thin blade in hand.  Pressing it against your armbinder, it comes apart with surprising ease.  &quot;You&#39;ve made it to your destination.  Two weeks behind schedule and in a *very* interesting manner, but you made it-- just as my better half promised.

It&#39;s your first time to truly reflect on what you had just endured-- the means by which you had escaped.  Looking down upon the tight laminate still cloaking your body, you work at stretching your arms and working your jaw, both prickling with firey pain as they&#39;re allowed to move once more.

Had you truly *enjoyed* the two weeks spent inside that box?  The way all who had looked upon you had seen a *doll* worth thousands of credits, a Torean rarity?  Did freedom not pale a bit when compared to a life lived so strangely, as a thing in glossy laminate, a cherished possession?

&quot;You both will be departing immediately-- the cover of darkness perhaps helping.  All you need to do is tell the woman at the counter you want &#39;to take a walk.&#39;&quot;

Turning your head, you look across the small cafe to where the cafe&#39;s attendent is slowly cleaning out a teacup.  She looks bored.

Without anything left to do you stand, making your way over to the counter as indicated.

&quot;Oh... I did not like *her*,&quot; Corinth whispers through her mask, having moved out of earshot.  Still, she watches her tongue as you approach the counter.

&quot;What will it be, ma&#39;am?&quot;  The attendant manning it asks.

To the unasked question the &#39;travel agent&#39; nods, and that seems like all the attendent needs.

&quot;Well then,&quot; she lifts the portion of the counter that allowed access to the area behind it.  &quot;Follow me.&quot;

Without waiting for you, she disappears into the backroom.  As you hesistate Corinth steps forward, the black glossy of her laminate rear the last thing you see before she too disappears.

They appear a bit... bootleg, mounted on a rolling cart and being smaller then the official ones you&#39;ve used thus far.  Beside them are a series of crates, in differing shapes and sizes.

Your guiding attendant ignores them completely however, instead moving towards an otherwise nondescript wall.  When she presses upon one of the durasteel bricks, however, it shifts-- revealing a hidden door, and a tunnel burrowed into it.

Producing a keycard, she offers it to Corinth-- who promptly hands it to you, as if not desiring the responsibility.   The attendant&#39;s eyes narrow, but she shrugs afterward, looking to you.

&quot;Go down the hallway, fourth door-- only one on your right.  The others won&#39;t open, so don&#39;t try it.&quot;

A spotlight suddenly ignites, hellishly bright in comparison, from the rooftop of the Terminal you now stand ready to exit.  Corinth groans quietly behind you.

Still-- you see your goal in the distance, a door that would have been too dark to make out had it not been for the red light blinking above it.  You&#39;re so close-- and the way is remarkably clear, an empty expanse of grass before you.

Either way you avoid them, but about halfway across another peril befalls you-- a searchlight arcing across the grass, then along the wall you&#39;re moving along.  It will reach you any moment.

Staying along the wall is safer, but will expose you-- even running will not escape that rapidly approaching light.  Otherwise you could break out across the grass, watching as best you can for mines.

It takes your eyes a good minute to regain vision, but by then you already know you&#39;re in trouble.  You had fallen, unable to get up-- the *why* explained when you can finally look down, revealing the thick laminate straps that have wrapped around your body.  A few feet back Corinth wriggles in a similar state, having already rolled onto her back, screaming in surprise-- a difficult enough endeavor given her regulating mask.

A flash of light, binding straps being launched in all directions?  You&#39;ve fallen into a typical Torean security device, and already you can hear voices approaching as a spotlight upon the Terminal circles your fallen form in a halo of bright light.

&quot;Prisoner #38511b, this court finds you *guilty.*&quot;

(colour: green)[Inventory cleared!]

The judge reigning over your case delivers the judgement to the quiet disinterest of the court, your fate having been decided upon in the short space of a few hours.  Despite the brevity you&#39;ve been a prisoner of the Ministry of Truants for several months now, and have grown accustomed to the sense of being little more then a number in the system.  Kneeling before the raised dais, your arms are pinned by the bright orange straitjacket that constituted the majority of your Truant&#39;s uniform.  Beneath it you wore a simple black catsuit, while at your throat you&#39;ve grown used to the tight cling of your tall, heavy collar.

The Judge continues, reading from his docket.  (if: $Servant is true)[&quot;Regarding the circumstances related to  your enslavement by the proprietor of *Club Lush*, this Court finds that contract to be valid, but unorthodox.  Thus you will be given a choice: to either accept the terms of your contract with the Club, and thus enter into slavery upon its premises... or to choose the opportunity for retraining and sale.  In this secondary circumstance, the ownership rights upon your person would be stripped from you, and you would be given training until such time as you can be auctioned by this Ringdom.  You would, however, quite obviously still be a slave, and would be registered as a contract-jumper-- which could influence your opportunities with regards to earning another collar.  Still... the choice is yours.  Speak it now.&quot;

Most people are homesteaders, the sort who will live on Tor Four their entire lives, you know?  But we wanted something different.

If we contact our employers, Steris, they provide the credits necessary to travel, for supples, lodgings, everything-- although obviously that comes out of the eventual bounty cuts we bring them in return.  But the catch is that Torei is too isolated for that.  Their credit network here is isolated, you have to exchange your chit for a Torean one upon arrival.

The results, however, are unexpected.

*Early removal of a slave suit involves a termination fee,* the Wardrobe warns.  *This fee is tripled for short term confinement, as your settings have indicated have occured.  There is a contract stripping fee, for the breaking of an agreed upon submission agreement between the suit wearer and the payer of the original suit&#39;s fines.  These fees are also tripled, for given the lateness of the current day.*

Torei has claimed you, remaking you in its image.](if: $Ending is 24)[Having passed through Celeste Academy, you have been enslaved and auctioned.  As a Ponygirl you live in a full harness, with bit in place, working long days performing menial labor.  It&#39;s a simple life, and one that has toned your athletic body.  It&#39;s hardly dignified of course, but you no longer care for such things.  All you need is the whip on your flank to tell you what to do.  Truly, Torei has claimed you, remaking you in its image.](if: $Ending is 25)[You may have rejected the Daemon&#39;s offer, but Mazos and Dahom are not so easily escaped-- and they claimed you in the end.

And that excites you.](if: $Ending is 27)[You&#39;re a slave now, property of Isabella Naram-Sin.  Submission and service define you, but you&#39;ve come to enjoy the sharp, commanding tone of your Mistress, and living in the lap of luxury does have its advantages-- even if you experience most of it on your knees.  Torei has claimed you, it seems, but you did go voluntarily.](if: $Ending is 28)[In fear and desperation you avoided your mysterious deal, and passed successfully through to the Way Up.

&quot;Prisoner #38511b, this court finds you *guilty.*&quot;

(colour: green)[Inventory cleared!]

The judge reigning over your case delivers the judgement to the quiet disinterest of the court, your fate having been decided upon in the short space of a few hours.  Despite the brevity you&#39;ve been a prisoner of the Ministry of Truants for several months now, and have grown accustomed to the sense of being little more then a number in the system.  Kneeling before the raised dais, your arms are pinned by the bright orange straitjacket that constituted the majority of your Truant&#39;s uniform.  Beneath it you wore a simple black catsuit, while at your throat you&#39;ve grown used to the tight cling of your tall, heavy collar.  Steel hardpoints, two to each side, are often used to afix the poles or leashes so often used upon Truants.

The Judge continues, reading from his docket.  (if: $Servant is true)[&quot;Regarding the circumstances related to  your enslavement by the proprietor of *Club Lush*, this Court finds that contract to be valid, but unorthodox.  Thus you will be given a choice: to either accept the terms of your contract with the Club, and thus enter into slavery upon its premises... or to choose the opportunity for retraining and sale.  In this secondary circumstance, the ownership rights upon your person would be stripped from you, and you would be given training until such time as you can be auctioned by this Ringdom.  You would, however, quite obviously still be a slave, and would be registered as a contract-jumper-- which could influence your opportunities with regards to earning another collar.  Still... the choice is yours.  Speak it now.&quot;

[[&quot;I choose to accept my collar from Club Lush...&quot;-&gt;LushEnd]]
[[&quot;I choose the opportunity to be auctioned.&quot;-&gt;AucEndChoice]]](else:)[&quot;You are hearby condemned by this court to the full penalties of the slave code, as outlined in Articles eight, thirteen, and forty-four.  Your legal rights are hereby striped, and your permanent registration as a slave ordered.  For next six months you will be admitted to a slave-training program, which will culminate in your eventual sale at auction.&quot;

He leans over his dias to meet your gaze.  &quot;Do you have any final words for this court, Prisoner #38511b?&quot;

[[&quot;No, Master.&quot;-&gt;PrisonerEnd4Nice]]
[[&quot;I accept my punishment, Master.&quot;-&gt;PrisonerEnd4Nice]]

Given this is Aekora, you would have full lawful and procedural powers.  That means arresting anyone in violation of the laws, and punishing them as appropriate.  Sometimes that means delivering correction on the street, as you see fit.  Often that means bringing them in, for trial, the Machinery of Corrections-- or both.&quot;

Conscript Officers have firm restrictions on their manner of living, their free time, and of course their work.  You can eventually work these off, much like an indentured servant, but you will be held to them until then.  That means full arrest quotas.  Fail to make *those*, and the commissioned Officer to who you are assigned will ensure you are punished for such poor work.&quot;

Dawn approaches, and with it your deadline.  A conscripted Officer who missed her quota could often have it worse then the Truants she was supposed to bring in, you&#39;ve learned that over these last few months.  But you&#39;re close-- needing only this last collar.  So why are you staring at the dead end of an alley?
(set: $Strike to 0)(set: $Status to 6)(set: $Gear to 11)
You followed her here, your mark, after she ran.  Offworlders often proved rather ungainly in Torean-style heels, but she had set a good pace in your footrace, turning the corner into this alley just ahead of you.  And now she&#39;s disappeared.

Anastasia, in her black catsuit.  She doesn&#39;t look happy.

Every port needs its back door, and if a few slaves slip out it who cares?  Nikaido doesn&#39;t, that&#39;s why she called me.&quot;

Then you&#39;re going back to the Ministry, for the full treatment.  Trial, probably enslavement-- and I&#39;m going to make sure there is a nice, big, black mark on your record.&quot;

Making your way to the foyer, you find a man staring in stark wonder at Lush&#39;s cacophony of Torean excess.

He&#39;s a bit late in noticing you were speaking to *him*, and when he looks your way he does a double-take, both trying to avoid staring and proving remarkably incapable of it.  &quot;H-Hi...&quot; he manages, eyes widening as he glimpses your panties.

&quot;I think... I took I tried the high dive first, and that&#39;s a bad idea, if you know what I mean...&quot;

He&#39;s gone, back out the door.  It&#39;s not a good look, losing a patron so quickly, but you have other concerns-- other tables to serve.  Focusing on them the rest of the night passes quickly, until you&#39;re seeing out the last utterly drunk customer before closing the front door and locking it.

Your feet are aching from being in such heels all night, your laminate is scuffed and less than glossy in a few places, and you&#39;re quite hungry-- but your duties are not over.

Exploring your tight waist he moves down your hips, over your skirts and petticoat before gliding underneath.

He smiles, matching your own, as you eventually break from the embrace-- and guide him to a table.  The man may have been skittish, but he proves to have deep pockets, spending lavishly for the rest of the evening.  He eventually leaves just before dawn, utterly spent, and incredibly drunk.  Still, you provide a parting kiss when requested, seeing him out before closing the front door and locking it.

He steps before you.  (if: $Strike is 0)[&quot;And what a poor night it was, I&#39;m afraid.  I received complaints from a couple that you failed to show them due respect, and then mistakenly brought them the wrong order?  This is most unacceptable, I&#39;m sure you know that.&quot;

He uses his glass to shock you, *hard*.  The pain lances through your womanhood, drawing the strength from your legs, sending you to your knees.  &quot;You will need to do better, going forward, he notes.  &quot;Another night like this, and I will give you one off-- in a corrections chair, edging you to the point of climax so long you truly start thinking with your cunt.

[[&quot;Y-Yes Master.&quot;-&gt;Lush12]]](if: $Strike is 1 or 2)[&quot;And it proved to be a passable night, I suppose.  There weren&#39;t any complaints against you, and your clit didn&#39;t report too many punishment shocks, but your sales do leave something to be desired.

[[&quot;Yes, Master.&quot;-&gt;Lush12]]](if: $Strike is &gt; 4)[&quot;And it proved to be an *impressive* night, I must admit.(if: $Strike is 7)[ A couple reported good service, well done and thorough.

Let&#39;s give her a round of applause, girls?&quot;

The rest of your fellow slaves clap, but its Kaleb that gives you the true reward-- a nice long activation of your clit piercing, send to *reward*.  The pleasurable sensations rage through your womanhood, causing your legs to quiver then give out, forcing you to kneel.  Yet the reward continues, driving you closer and closer to sweet release, orgasm-- only for your Master to halt it there.  Wet and moaning, you look up to him.

&quot;A couple more nights like this, and I might let you cum,&quot; he smiles.  &quot;Do you want that, slave?&quot;

Along with the other slaves you&#39;ve been returned to your individual cages, the doors locked, the time yours as you will.  Without much to do, and knowing the coming night would see you working the Club&#39;s floor again, most of the other slaves are already asleep.  You lie away on your small cot however, one hand laying upon your waist, the other running a finger along your collar.

This is it: your life going forward.  Nights spent serving in the bar, coaxing money from tourists and Toreans alike.  Mornings cleaning.  And the day?  Reserved for sleep, as best you could find it while still in full uniform.  Master Kaleb will send you through the Wardrobe Device come evening, to refresh your outfit, but you best get used to laminate-- you&#39;ll be wearing it near constantly, going forward.

Who could have imagined this would be how it would end?  That morning, now long ago, where you had awoken chained to your own bed, memory full of holes but free.  Now?  Now you&#39;re just another slave on Torei, lost in laminate...

These appear to have formed something like a box or two once upon a time, but ripped apart and exposed to the elements its mostly just trash now, utterly useless.

But as you pull away the battered laminate you find something *else*.  A manhole cover, presumably leading to the local transit tunnels.  Your quarry must have fled downward!

As it is you pull the grate open, heeled shoes hooking into each rung as you quickly clamber down.

Dismounting, you pull forth a small *glass* device, flicking it into action.  Light springs forth, although you would only need it heading one direction-- to your left the way is dark, pitch black even.  To your right however light can be seen in the distance.

Much of the more mountainous portions of Torei were riddled with such passageways, some still being used for slaves to move products and packages, but most had been abandoned-- the Way Up having brought far too much commerce into the region for such narrow passages to provide for.  

More relevent however, is your inability to see the path ahead without your flashlight.  Had you been without it you doubt anyone could make out where they were going, a fact that dawns on you just as you hit a dead-end-- an ancient tunnel collapse sealing the path forward.  Your prey may have came here to hide, but without a flashlight she wouldn&#39;t have braved it herself on the run.  You&#39;ve gone the wrong way!

Your training as a Cadet helps however, and as you turn the corner you see her-- running towards the reservoir.  Torei had precious little water, making the reservoir a strategic asset for the Ringdom.  Your truant appears to be less interested in the liquid wealth, making instead for an automated cleaning barge about to set out from the shore.  Circling the holding pond would take a good twenty minutes, you will have lost her by then!

Thinking quickly you reach for your belt, where a variety of Ministry enforcement devices hang-- although only two truly have the possibility of being useful right now.

Neither baton nor your restraint-gun are in range before she jumps aboard the barge, and it seperates from the dock.  Once safe she turns around, waving, a smile on her face.

She almost looks familiar, but at this range your curiosity-- and Truant quota-- goes unsated.

[[Either way, Nikaido won&#39;t be happy about this.-&gt;OffEscape2]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1816" name="OffEscape2" tags="" position="2053,30006" size="100,100">Your chamber is small, but clear, the walls some manner of transparent plastic.  It provides a nice view of your Precinct&#39;s yard, but such environs provide a second feature: the sunlight falling upon you is amplified and contained.  You&#39;re sweating from every pore, almost delirious with thirst, with your arms bound above you to the steel post your back is against.

You returned twelve hours ago having missed your quota.

Normally this little stake-out was reserved for particularly reticent guests of your Ministry, but Nikiado had thought you deserved the opportunity to think about your recent choices-- this isn&#39;t the first time you&#39;ve failed her standards, and you sense she won&#39;t accept many more missed quotas.

Yet as you consider what could be called your Torean &#39;career&#39; you cannot help but look up, where rising above the buildings of Grand Aekora the Way Up can be glimpsed in the far distance.  Was this truly better then the collar you had escaped by accepting conscription?  Were you not part of the problem?  And what had it earned you?

The line of sweat that runs down your nose to drip off, falling upon the laminate of your chest seems to answer that.  Nikaido had suggested a reprieve at nightfall, which had to be coming soon.  You best consider how you would beg for her mercy, that would certainly be demanded of you.

She&#39;s simply too far ahead to reach, a fact demonstrated by her making the final jump to reach the barge ahead of you.  By the time you reach the dock its already drifting out, too far for you to follow.  Once realizing she was safe your quarry turns around, waving, a smile on her face.

She almost looks familiar, but at this range your curiosity-- and Truant quota-- goes unsated.

Sliding to a halt you pull it up, trading pinpoint accuracy with sheer volume as you squeeze off one shot, two shots, three.  The black pellets cross the distance in mere moments, one missing with a splat beside your quarry, but the other two strike against her legs.  Instantly the reactive compound expands, at first slowing the Truant then tripping her up entirely, the sticky restraint having roped between both legs.

Marching up to her, you cannot help but to smile.

She&#39;s still on her stomach as you approach, allowing you to place a knee firmly in her back as you deploy your cuffs.  Soon her arms are pinned behind, allowing you to activate the quick-lam&#39;s solvant, breaking its hold upon her legs.  Hauling her to her feet, you move her towards the nearby wall-- regulations demanded a thorough search of her person as the first step of detainment.

Yet as you do so she looks over her shoulder, and you finally get a good look at your Truant.  

[[You know her!-&gt;OffWin2]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1820" name="OffWin2" tags="" position="1633,30255" size="100,100">&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/MEKIk40.png&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; height=&quot;50%&quot;&gt;

It&#39;s been months, but you recall her clearly-- she&#39;s the tourist who had approached you ever so briefly when you were first detained after Club Lush, the one who had sought to touch you in her curiosity.  She had paid for it with an eventual cage beside you that evening, but obviously your paths had diverged-- she was still free, and you... had become part of the system that would certainly send her to a collar for another infraction.  That fact and your identity she is clearly aware of as well, as she speaks.

&quot;Oh my, it&#39;s you!  Please!  They will send me to auction if I&#39;m arrested again!  You&#39;re an offworlder, right?  Me too.  Please... can&#39;t you... just let me go?  I&#39;m making for the Way Up, I swear.  I&#39;m leaving, you will never see me again.&quot;

Her story is much the same as your own-- a rush towards the space elevator, options narrowing as the collar tightens around her neck.  Yours had ended... like *this*, however.  Would you condemn her as well?

[[Let her go... damn the consequences.-&gt;OffLetGo]]

Or merely a sense to help your fellow offworlder?  Either way, you eventually reach down, undoing her cuffs.  She turns around, clearly surprised-- yet already stepping away, as if afraid you would change your mind.  Its not an unfounded idea, Truant Officers could be fickle indeed.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; she nevertheless says.  &quot;From the bottom of my heart... thank you.  I won&#39;t forget this.&quot;

And with that, she departs.  You&#39;re not sure what her remembering will do for you, but you can be certain Officer Nikaido won&#39;t be happy about this.  You&#39;re going to come in under quota.

[[You make for the barracks.-&gt;OffEscape2]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1822" name="OffArrestHer" tags="" position="1633,30404" size="100,100">Ignoring her begging, you set about your work: pressing her against the wall, followed by a thorough search of her every curve.  When she continues to speak you deploy your shock baton, but the mere threat does give you blissful silence.

By the time the transport wagon arrives you have her prepped, making loading her into a cage all the easier.  As she had endured months ago, locked into a small cage with vibrating cocks lodged in cunt and ass you now repeat the procedure, damning her to a long torturous ride-- and of course a probably collar after her trial.

Torean justice, delivered by your hand-- which your superior, Officer Nikaido, notes as she steps up before you.

She takes advantage of the latter, running her hand up between your thighs, almost possessively.  Like most commissioned officers she mostly used your cunt as a focus for punishment, but the occasional bit of teasing seemed to indicate when she was pleased indeed.  Here she rubs a finger up against your slit, the thin laminate between her finger and your womanhood only emphasizing the sensation.

You&#39;re force to merely maintain your pose, staring ahead as she continues.  &quot;You&#39;re proving to be quite adapt at this, I must admit.  Keep it up.  You could be free from your conscription in a decade or two, wouldn&#39;t that be grand?  Come now, Officer.  We do still have to string up your capture, teach her a little lesson, hm?&quot;

As always you follow behind her diligently, climbing aboard the transport.  With nary a whisper the quiet vehicle begins to move, heading deeper into Grand Aekora.  In the distance you catch sight of the Way Up, so far away and growing more distant, before its eclipsed by a taller building and thus from view.

Passing through the portal you get your first glimpse of your assigned Headmistress, standing behind her desk.  Her dress is red, tight laminate that colelcts together in a pencil skirt that ended just below the knees.  Black frills provide ornamentation there, coordinating with her gloves and heels, and matching the feathers around her shoulders-- those being of both black and red.  It&#39;s an imposing outfit, one that is matched by her sharp expression, crimson lips pulled into a line that suggests frequent dissappointment.  She *was* an instructor, after all.

For example: a soubrette may resemble what you Offworlders deem a mere *maid*, but the expectations upon her are much higher.  She must engage with guests, dancing along the thin line of teasing and insubordination-- in short, she must think for herself, as a slave.  The same can be said of a concubine, even if such a simple sexual object is relatively low value.  A ponygirl, meanwhile, or one of our dolls are just the opposite.

Ah, perhaps you are simply trying to mind your manners?  Well, one could not ask for a better introduction to the second metric.&quot;

She taps the rightmost portion of the chart.  &quot;A harder measure, but just as important for your placement: that of *independence*.  Many slaves believe that service simply requires submission, and while that is true in the basic sense, this does not suit all roles well.  For example: a soubrette may resemble what you Offworlders deem a mere *maid*, but the expectations upon her are much higher.  She must engage with guests, dancing along the thin line of teasing and insubordination-- in short, she must think for herself, as a slave.  The same can be said of a concubine, even if such a simple sexual object is relatively low value.  A ponygirl, meanwhile, or one of our dolls are just the opposite.  They do not think for themselves, and are not expected to.&quot;

Until then, you will be trained in more basic matters-- on Torean culture and history, submission, and your new role within it.&quot;

She circles the desk, coming up beside you.  You both may be heeled, but she&#39;s still taller.  &quot;Your day will begin promptly before dawn, when you will wake and clean yourself before entering one of our Wardrobes for a fresh uniform.  Makeup is *not* applied, you will do that yourself to practice.  Afterward, inspection and assignments for the day.  Morning classes will follow, which will vary.  Lunch comes precisely at noon.  Like most slaves on this planet, you will be fed slave gruel.  The taste is quite poor, I am told, but it is nutritious-- you will need only that singular meal per day.  Afternoon classes afterward.  Evenings are spent cleaning, a good thing to practice for any slave-- we do keep Celeste looking impeccable.  Before you go to bed there is also a small window for correction or, rarely, rewards.  Then bed.&quot;

The riding crop is extended before you, the thick laminate tip spun in short circles.  &quot;We have two types of beds here, and you are allowed to choose between them.  The first is a cage, which you would be locked into each night.  For your comfort the floor is padded.  Or you may choose a bed, it is a simple cot with laminate sheets, but it does come with an additional requirement: you will be awoken an hour early, to serve at the faculty table while we have breakfast.&quot;

She smiles, her crimson lips seemingly ill-suited for the expression.  &quot;The choice is yours.&quot;

The *Charm Club* proves to be an interesting affair, your efforts largely directed towards how best to appear alluring-- and how to tease when necessary.  Its a fine line that&#39;s demonstrated most aptly by the dress they give you, a tight pink laminate shealth leaving you opened backed, a black bolero-like accoutrement atop providing a hint of class, although that effect is lessened when you&#39;re taught how best to undo the buttons and slide it from your toned frame.  Eventually it dawns on you, as you straddle another student, pinning her hands above her head as you lean in with a smile, that there was something liberating in all of this.  You&#39;ve been denied anything like dignity, but with your collar comes a free pass to abandon such concerns, to give into your natural sensuality.

&quot;To get the obvious worry out of the way, no, you&#39;re not in trouble,&quot; Vallis continues, indeed setting your mind at ease.  &quot;We&#39;re here to talk about your progress so far, your valuation, and to provide an opportunity to increase it further.&quot;

Now, whomever decides to buy you at auction will be free to make changes to you as they desire, that is their right, but that would come after purchase-- and it is usually in your best interest to seek a higher valuation before that occurs, yes?&quot;

They provide a nearly endless selection of operative improvements to one&#39;s body, from something as simple as rounding out your measurements, to far more extreme procedures.

We like them nice and full.  Tagging would then be performed, installing a subdermal identification chip beneath your skin-- a requirement for all Academy slaves, to ensure you can be returned to your eventual owner if you were every seperated.

Piercings at the tongue and clit as well, rounding out your three pleasure points-- and the subdermal chip, tagging you for any scanning device to identify as propery.  Then your gag reflex will be permanently surpressed, an annoying quirk of evolution most slaves are eventually freed from.&quot;

She taps her chin, thinking.  &quot;I do belive that is it.  Rainbow implants would be grand, but some buyers do prefer their slaves be without them, for whatever reason, and we do not wish to harm your value.  Thus they would skipped, for now.  How does that sound?&quot;

&quot;Good.  Your training begins tomorrow, then.  As a Concubine you will be given a small bed, to which you will be leashed each night.  Training will take several weeks, and after that will come your auction.  I can only hope you will fetch an acceptable price for the Academy.  Eyes down.&quot;

Your eye contact breaks as you follow her command without even fully thinking of it, to which Vallis merely begins collecting your file back together.  Your submission was expected at this point after all, unworthy of commentary.  Instead she waves a hand towards the far door.

Just *who* purchased you isn’t exactly clear however, the bright lights upon you making it impossible to see much of the crowd.  All you hear is a final call for bids, a dramatic pause, and then the final symbolic snap of the auctionmaster’s whip to signal a fresh sale. 

Much of the rest of the morning and afternoon is filled with administrative duties, although that is handled by the myriad of secretarial slaves who served the market.  In the meantime you’re kept in a common cell with about a dozen other recently sold slaves, milling about, utterly ignored.  That indifference only breaks upon the arrival of a Master or Mistress to finally collect their property, as one by one your cellmates are led out.  You’re one of the last, but upon hearing your name you snap up to your feet for your first glimpse of your new owner.

Only the shame remains, and that grows dimmer with each sensation that emanates from your tortured, rapturous cunt.  The thought of your womanhood sends your hands downward, playing across your encapsulated breasts, down along your strictly corseted waist, to the meeting of your thighs.

&quot;Governess!&quot;  

The call for you breaks the quiet contemplation of the morning, sunlight streaming in from the veranda just outside your window.  You had been shining yourself for the day, your Master&#39;s wardrobe providing an acceptable gleam-- but you always strived to look better than that.  To set an example.

Turning your head the tight choker of a collar at your neck makes itself known, reminding you of your place even when others look to you for direction-- or in fear.  The former seems to motivate the slave in the doorway.  &quot;Governess, I&#39;m sorry to interrupt... but the new serving girls just arrived.  Would you like them at attention, or stored for later?

They&#39;re all Torean-born, they *know* just what you are.  A governess, a slave who directed others, who wanted nothing more then their submission and service-- and would punish freely if they failed.

Drawing up before them you give your prepared speech, a short little thing well practiced by now-- your Master owned considerable property in Aekora&#39;s rural districts, and new slaves were a common enough occurence.  You speak of their place here upon the estate, of the expectations going forward, and of your shared Master.  They seem unrefined, but you will work on that.  By the whip or your gentle touch, you&#39;ve helped sculpt many slaves thus far.

When you conclude you shift them into a clean line, on their knees, then delegate their orientation to another of your sub-slaves.  You have accounts to go over, a corrective punishment to administer at noon, and of course your daily routine...

[[And the day goes on...-&gt;GovEnd5]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1954" name="GovEnd5" tags="" position="1560,39719" size="100,100">That night your new charges join with the other slaves of the estate in the backyard of the manse, where you&#39;re staked out upon the ground, four heavy steel rods linked to the cuffs that draw your limbs firmly apart.  

You&#39;ve done nothing wrong, indeed your work these past months has been nothing less then exemplary, but you understand why you need to be punished-- the other slaves needed to see, on occasion, that even you could be humbled.  You are authority to them, which made such treatment all the more effective at demonstrating your collective Master&#39;s superiority over you all.

It hurts, the whipping that follows, but through the pain you nevertheless derive a good bit of pleasure, despite it all.  When your Master asks for an admission of guilt, you give it freely, writhing in your bondage as he strikes you again... it hurts so good, and you *do* deserve it, don&#39;t you?

Your client this evening is an offworlder, as many of them have proven to be.  So many came to Torei with credits to burn, and so often *you* represented the dream that had motivated them in the first place: a feminine figure in gleaming laminate to have upon their arm, to laugh at their asides, to make them stand out in the crowd, to satisfy their every desire...

Tonight that put you in a tight laminate dress, black at its center but semi-transparent along your flanks-- well considered for the charity gala you&#39;re attending, your client being the young owner of an upstart shipping consortium.  The Ringdom of Alem prominently abutted the Way Up, which explained why many of those attending were offworlders and tourists-- but that only makes you stand out all the more.  You&#39;re a statement, a demonstration of your client&#39;s Torean links and mindset.  The collar at your throat underlines that, drawing carefully concealed stares you&#39;ve nevertheless been taught to identify.  They&#39;re *curious*, some even jealous as they look to the locked circlet of silvered steel and then to your client, who wears the key for it around his neck.

Other small locks decorate your body, at your back, upon your shoes.  It was all part of the game, the contract.  For the night he owned you, in every sense of the word.

[[You smile brightly, leaning in to whisper sweet nothings in his ear...-&gt;ConsortEnd4]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1956" name="ConsortEnd4" tags="" position="1860,39572" size="100,100">Hours pass, and the gala moves through stages you&#39;re now familiar with: the greetings, the toasts, the announcements, a presentation-- then the breaking up into smaller groups, mingling, where the true credits passed between hands.  Throughout you attend your client, speaking only when spoken to but doing so well, occasionally leaning in to whisper something-- practical or merely suggestive-- as the situation demanded.  

Except for the serving girls you&#39;re the only slave in attendance, it seems, and that does put you at a bit of a disadvantage-- your heels are more aggressive, your dress so very revealing, that as time ticks by you feel the fatigue building.  But you don&#39;t have a choice in how things went, and you know it.  Instead you merely refocus on your work, leaning forward to emphasize your chest as you address a seemingly impressionable young heiress, performing a Torean reverence just to get the proper rise out of a very fresh looking tourist, allowing your client to tighten your waist cincher just a bit further before he relocks it...

In the darkened bedroom of his suite you stand before your client as he slowly works through your locks, undoing them one by one-- but he retains the collar, as expected.  So many seemed pleased by that particular decoration.  Freed from your strictures he undresses you, pulling free your laminate and casting it aside before guiding you down upon the bed.  There *you* take the lead, even if he doesn&#39;t know it.  Adjusting positions, volunteering your mouth-- doing everything in your power to further his satisfaction.

Dawn finds you dressed again, waiting on the Torean streets for a ponygirl rickshaw to pick you up.  Returning to your owner you will finally be allowed a bit of sleep before the cycle repeats itself, another client waiting for you tonight.  You recall they had requested a more outwardly submissive outfit, which would probably mean using a laminate hood.  That&#39;s unfortunate, you&#39;ve always hated how they pull on your hair.

Months later, and the stars have changed.  After so long on Torei you noticed that first.  Yerev Prime is a cosmopolitan world, a place of peace and neutrality, but you&#39;re here because it could be found the galaxy&#39;s outer rim, as near to Torei itself as one could get.  You may have left the planet but its hold upon you remains absolute, as the heavy collar around your throat attests.

As one of the half dozen ceremonial guards owned by the Eastern Trade Delegation, an alliance of Torean traders looking to deal more directly with the ships that brought Torei the imports it had come to depend upon, you&#39;re owned directy by Envoy Sharo.  She&#39;s within the Torean embassy, but you remain outside, standing at attention in the red uniform locked upon you.  

The laminate is a bit heavier then you&#39;re used to, the limited supplies of resin for the Wardrobes requiring you wear the suit assigned you for much longer periods then most Toreans would find acceptable.  To your side rests a stun baton, you&#39;re trained in its use but the Envoy kept less visible guards that would deal with any problems-- your role is to be seen, to demonstrate Torei for anyone brought to the embassy out of curiosity.

Looking out from your heavy mask, you&#39;re greeted with a small crowd, Torei being infamous enough to draw such attention.

[[You&#39;ve been out here for hours already...-&gt;GuardEnd4]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1959" name="GuardEnd4" tags="" position="3314,39579" size="100,100">*&quot;Is she really a slave?&quot;*

*&quot;Look at her collar!&quot;*

*&quot;I heard they never talk!&quot;*

The gossip and discussion follows familiar lines, and your training demanded you ignore such talk-- although the situation does change when a young man steps from the crowd, drawing closer.  You can see it in his eyes, a certain curiosity-- and attraction.  Your suit leaves little to the imagination, after all.

He stops a step or two away, clearly conflicted.

Taking that step clearly draws the attention of the crowd, hushed exchanges being match by the man leaning in, as if to look through the opaque glass of your helmet.  Of course, he can&#39;t.

Realizing that, he points to your arm, a simple enough gesture.  &quot;M-May I?&quot;

Clearly he wanted to feel your laminate.

[[Direct him.-&gt;Guard6]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1961" name="Guard5Remain" tags="" position="3389,39728" size="100,100">You remain firmly in place, the slow passage of the planet&#39;s twin suns above the sole bit of movement as reflections glide across your glossy uniform.

[[Direct him.-&gt;Guard6]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1962" name="Guard6" tags="" position="3306,39887" size="100,100">With sudden alacrity you reach forward, seizing his hand.  The man nearly jumps out of his loose, textile-based pants-- but you hold firm, pulling him closer.  Chest to chest you tilt your helmet as you guide his hand down, where he would would never had the courage to explore: the space between your legs.  

Your suit lacks a zipper there, or any other means of access-- chastity being required of you-- but the touch alone is electric.  Even so he&#39;s disappointingly *tourist-minded* and when you finally release pulls back immediately-- blushing heavily.  You meanwhile retake your previous position, shock-pole held beside you as the crowd works through what they had just witnessed.

[[Torean hospitality, at its finest.-&gt;Guard7]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1963" name="Guard7" tags="" position="3306,40037" size="100,100">Later you stand at the ready before the Ceremonial Guard&#39;s captain, something like a governess given power over you and your sisters in service.  Legs spread, hands locked behind your back by the mag-cuffs integrated into the uniform, she&#39;s looking through your report for the day.

&quot;Everything seems to be in order,&quot; she notes, reaching up to place her hands to either side of your head.  Once there she lifts your helmet, the lock undoing automatically at her touch-- allowing you the first breath of unregulated air in sometime.  More directly it reveals your gag, a heavy panel style anchored by the straps that encircle your head.  The offworlders had been right in that, at least-- you *were* incapable of speech.

The captain deactivates her *glass*.  &quot;Envoy Sharo took notice of your little display, with the man today.  She authorized a few minutes of pleasure activation via your rainbow implants, but your orgasm restriction remains-- is that clear?&quot;

When you nod she reaches down, activating the piercings and implants that allowed your sensual hotspots to be toyed with so easily.  As the captain leaves you&#39;re left to the small cell assigned you, thrusting your hips in vain as the pleasure runs through you...

Months later, you stir slowly after a long night’s sleep.  Blinking with bleary eyes, for a moment you forget where you are, *what* you are.  It’s the bell at your throat that provides the first reminder, followed shortly after by the sensation of tight restraints, all-encompassing laminate, and the view of your cage’s bars coming into focus.  

You’re Mistress Royallis’ kitten.

A black catsuit serves as the foundation for the uniform you wear daily, often for weeks at a time.  Your legs are folded up and back, heavy straps securing them there to ensure you can crawl.  More liberty is allowed to your arms, relatively, but the mittens locked onto your hands prevent any use of your fingers.  At best you can paw at things, and little more.  The corset at your waist doesn’t exactly match the feline aesthetic, but it does fit Torean expectations, and the white trim along its edges and busks does tie into the alabaster off-coloring that marks your paws, while providing a bit of color to your mask.  A bright red collar, your tail behind, and of course your customary gag completes the ensemble, the latter a heavy panel design atop a ring gag that left you capable of mewling cries only.

2) Several of the current endings, primarily those that occur if you are placed in the Academy, could be expanded upon-- if I find myself in the mood.  The goal would be to make them more like the Truant Officer and Lush Serving Girl options, where a small scene plays afterward.

The cage you’re in is small, although the fact it denied you the space to stand is muted by the restraints that prevented you anyway.  It does allow you the room to turn and look about however, and you do, the bell affixed to your collar ringing softly as you do so.

Your Mistress’ mid-town estate could be described as palatial, her wealth on full display from the sheer size of the room you occupy to its gilded furnishings and sharp, modern design tones.  Your cage is in her sitting room, experience informing you that the door across from you led to the rest of the mansion, while the double-set nearest your cage entered into her personal office.  From here she conducted her business, meeting with business contacts and guests. 

You, meanwhile, served merely as her pet.

After months of training, after months of service, you almost feel more naturally inclined to your uniform.  Life was certainly easier, or at the very least simple, locked into your uniform, serving as your Mistress’ pet.

It was not comfortable, of course.  The bondage that kept you crawling had been difficult to adapt to, although Royallis had taken you to the Ministry of Improvements shortly after purchase, giving you many of the Torean slave adaptions to ease some of the burden.  Still, the butt plug that anchored your laminate tail remained a constant source of teasing discomfort, and your cat food was laced with supplements to force your libido up to Torean-born levels.  Sensuality in general, and your cunt in particular, thus occupy your thoughts most of the time.  Actually stimulating yourself is impossible however, even if your catsuit has a simple zipper between your legs to provide access.  With your paws, you could never budge it.

“Such a little lover you are, this morning.  But I *do* need you to sit, Cici.”

As ordered, you sit back on your haunches, kneeling before her, legs spread.  Reaching up you place your arms to each side of your chest, paws folded down in a display of total submission.  Such efforts are rewarded with Alexandra’s hand upon your head, the slick laminate of her glove sliding effortlessly against your hood as she pets you affectionately.  

“Good girl, Cici.”  Her hand drifts down, idly playing with your breast as she continues.  “I know it will disappoint you, but my schedule today is very full.  I won’t have much time, if any, to play with you.  But to make it up to you I have a surprise…”

[[“Mmmgh?”-&gt;CatSurprise]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1987" name="CatSurprise" tags="" position="2408,40279" size="100,100">“Wait here.”  Disappearing into her office, your position and the doors preventing you from seeing inside at the moment, she returns momentarily with a small device held before her.  Perhaps a few inches across and round in shape, a bright LED flashes green upon the top.

“A new toy,” your Mistress explains readily, setting it down before you.  When it fails to move she nudges it closer, to which it suddenly speeds away on what must be small wheels beneath.  You fight some instinctual desire to chase it immediately, as Alexandra explains.

“A toy, and a challenge, Cici.  It’s set to flee you.  Well, your collar at least.  I’ve been assured its quite difficult for a kitten to catch.  But if you do catch it before the sun sets this evening, you will earn a special treat: it will trigger your Rainbow array, and let you cum.”

Mere mention of being allowed to cum draws a quiet purr from deep within you, the training and alterations you’ve enduring having induced a near constant state of arousal in you.  It’s a reaction that draws Alexandra’s hand up to your chin, her thumb running across the slick laminate that covered your mouth.  

“I knew you would like that.”

Otherwise the day is yours, Cici.  I will be in my Office, but of course your collar will restrict you to this room.  I have a meeting this afternoon, your feeding time is at noon… and I do believe that is it.”

She looks to you, a kneeling laminate kitten, as helpless as you are glossy.

Passing into her office, she shuts the door behind her.

The other two, the door to your Mistress’ office and the door leading to her garden are closed, and you certainly lack the means of opening them.  

But even within your room there are a variety of things for you to do, the newest of course being the small toy Alexandra had just presented.  Your time at the Academy had demonstrated you capable of managing a bit of independence, and thus you now have it, but your time is not unlimited.

He’s tall, as many Torean-dwelling men are, wearing laminate professional wear in the form of a well-cut vest and undershirt, the later’s sleeves rolled up.  Glancing about at the décor, he stops suddenly upon noticing you upon the floor nearby.  A firm slap on (if: $CorSlave is true)[Corinth’s](else:)[the soubrette’s] ass turns her around, as he speaks.

“I will have the documents signed and delivered to you, by protocol courier,” the man is saying, a laminate folder held casually in one hand.  “And I must say: I do look forward to the partnership.  Your markets, Mistress Royallis, will ensure my product makes it to buyers with enough left over for both of us to profit handsomely.”

Alexandra smiles brightly, as across the room (if: $CorSlave is true)[Corinth](else:)[her soubrette] enters, taking a respectful position to the side of the door they both approach.  Waving away her slave’s assistance, your Mistress instead gestures the way forward herself.  “Allow me to walk you to the door, Master Tenyon” she adds, “and I can assure you I too look forward to the partnership.”

You are ignored, meanwhile.  This was not the sort of conversation a pet would ever come up in.

Through the open portal you can see the entrance foyer, Alexandra’s office and thus your playroom being set off to the side.  By the standards of Aekora’s nobility it’s of relatively modest size, but you are downtown, and that severely limited the space available for housing.

As soon as your feline-eared head passes the gateway however you feel a sharp shock that emanates from your collar.  Surprise as much as pain drives you back, your corset momentarily on full display as you rear up, shuffling backwards in alarm.  The shock had ended quickly, but the lingering pain is a good reminder of what your owner had mentioned, and you would do well to remember—your collar served as an invisible leash.  As a pet you’re not trusted to wander, and Alexandra did make it clear you were not to leave the room without permission.

[[At least it was a quick lesson.-&gt;CatHub]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="1998" name="CatNap" tags="" position="2400,40989" size="100,100">Crossing the room on your paws and knees, you seek out a comfortable position.  Quickly you spot three potential candidates.  The first is your cage, the door still standing open.  The bottom is padded with a soft rubber, and you do always feel a bit more at calm within it—given how often you’re locked inside.  A second option is the sofa at the center of the room, the plush cushions *very* comfortable.   Your Mistress allowed you up as well.  The third and final option, meanwhile, is a spot on the floor—the hardened laminate that almost looked like wooden paneling rather uncomfortable, but with the bonus of being directly situated beneath the sunlight pouring in from the high window on the wall opposite.

You’ve been with your owner long enough to know why, however, and in truth it’s a rather clever design.  If desired the wall could be turned on to reveal its purpose as a large vid-screen, capable of projecting whatever Alexandra or her guests desired.  If not engaged however, such as now, approaching it had a different effect—one you witness as the white paneling shimmers and then dissipates, dissolving into transparency.  The wall could be a *window*, running from floor to ceiling.

Your Mistress’ midtown estate was but a few minutes from the center of Grand Aekora, providing easy access to its myriad amenities while also allowing for the space she desired.  As her pet however, your main concern is that the window allowed you a glimpse out at the world beyond—one you had so recently walked yourself.

But those days are long past.  Now you find yourself seeking simpler things: the attention of your Mistress, the diversions of your toys, and of course the constant frustration focused primarily between your legs.  

Between the Torean compounds in your food that ensured a strong, Torean-like libido, the liberal use of your rainbow control package, and the constant frustrations of your bondage, Mistress Alexandra was clearly keen on keeping you constantly aroused.  Pleasuring yourself of course was strictly forbidden, but your owner rarely punished you unless caught in the act—cats so rarely followed human rules, after all.

Perhaps it’s the laminate, or the bondage, or your new Torean sex drive, but it takes you awhile to understand—yet you do eventually get it.  Approach vector, stealth, none of it mattered.  The device was tracking you by your collar, after all.  You can’t surprise it, but you *can* get a momentary advantage from attacking at its side.  It would still flee and the same distance, but the small wheels beneath needed to turn to do so from that angle, giving you a tiny headstart.

It’s a lesson you would do well to remember, but eventually the feline instincts cultivated in you overcome such a rational approach—and you cannot help but chase it.

Eventually you’re forced to a halt, breathing heavily down on all fours, wishing your gag was removed to allow for deeper breaths.  Instead you must simply call off the pursuit, your aching limbs and burning lungs demanding it of you.  Sweat slides along beneath your laminate, but it’s the similar sensation between your legs that draws your focus.  This effort, the constant shifting of your butt plug, the shifting of your breasts with every hobbled step, was arousing you.  

Mistress Alexandra had ensured you maintained a proper slave’s sense of sensuality, which meant a near constant state of arousal, but this was quickly growing worse than that—the idea of all this effort and frustration ending without you capturing the toy, and thus your promised allowance to cum, is almost painful to consider.  Even if you must rest now, you **need** to catch that toy!

There it waits, the LED blinking as if in amusement, as you come back to your “feet”.  Setting off after it again, you nevertheless feel you’ve missed your chance this time.

Your owner had not indicated exactly how the toy would notice it had been captured, but it apparently does, ceasing its attempts to escape after several moments.  The small indicator LED changes as well, from the red you had induced to a pulsing blue.

What comes next you only *feel*, a sensation across your body that can only be described as raw and unbridled *ecstasy*, emanating from several points at once.  Your breasts, your womanhood, your rear—points of sensuality, induced by the rainbow implants your owner required of all her slaves.

Eventually you roll onto your back, bound legs spread as your back arches, every nerve bundle acting of its own accord—furthering your pleasure.

Crying out in the throes of rapture, your gag and uniform reduce that to little more than a lengthened meow as your restrained limbs wriggle helplessly.  You’re not even fully aware of your own climax until its receding for some time, the pulses of pleasure running down your body slowing as you regain the ability to feel your sex-slickened cunt.  You’re wet, *very* wet, a bit of your own self-lubricant even escaping the zipper there to run down between your thighs.  Like any Torean kitten you pride yourself in staying clean and glossy, but as ecstasy shifts to afterglow you’re simply too exhausted to care.  What did that matter when put against the simple fact that you’ve been allowed to cum?

Sleep comes a bit slowly, but soon you drift into that sweet abyss.

Bright blue greets you, the sky above so very clear and empty.  Torei could go weeks without cloud cover, water being so valuable the AIs regulated even vapor carefully.  Nor did terrestrial vehicles flit about, as on other worlds.  Ground transport remained the primary means of travel.

But there is something else up there too, not so much floating as fixed in the sky above.  The Way Up, quite distant but still visible given its size, stretching like a thin black thread towards infinity.  You have long since stopped bothering with marking the passage of days, pets hardly needed to consider such things, but you suspect its been perhaps a year since your last fateful ride down that space elevator.  You had been a free woman, then, the world itself awaiting you.

Now you’re collared and bound, unable to walk, unable to talk, the property of another.  The small tag hanging from your collar named you Cici, while your tail and paws mark you as a catgirl, a pet.  It’s been quite the transformative experience.

Even so, as you rise up on your haunches, pressing your chest against the window as you gaze curiously at the strangers passing by, most ignore you.  You’re just one slave among the multitudes now after all, even if your situation is a bit more restrictive than most.  

You do eventually attract a passing woman’s attention however, a freewomb gauging by her lack of collar.  She squats down before the window, pressing her hand against it, as if capable of reaching through the glass to pat you gently on the head.

But it may have well be in orbit, for all the good that would do you.  Your collar is locked around your throat, incapable of being removed even if you had hands instead of the paws of a kitten.  It prevents you from wandering, just as it marks you so clearly as a slave.  Even without it, there are your other pieces of bondage, your feline uniform so very distinctive.  And then the tracking chip embedded beneath your skin, as most slaves were subjected to, alongside the rainbow implants that could engaged at great distance.  

Torei depended on its slaves, valued them—and worked very hard to keep the collared multitudes in line.  There is no escape.  It’s a realization that makes you a little wet.

Nor does your frustrated struggling seem to impart he message, in fact it manages just the opposite, the woman bringing a hand to her lips as she laughs gently at your display.

Mimicking a head pat once more she rises, returning to her path down the street.  You’re left in her wake, the laminate kitten in the window to her perspective.

Then she rises, returning to her path along the pavement, leaving you in her wake.  

Flicking your hips back and forth, and thus your tail, you catch yourself wishing she could somehow play with you.

Returning to her path along the sidewalk she leave you in her wake, utterly frustrated.  Your hips flick almost of their own accord, your tail expressing your sexual distress despite a lack of audience.

Rolling onto your back you spread your legs, the bindings holding shin to thigh straining, but for once not impeding what you want to do.  Framing your chest, one arm to each side, you slide your paws down your own flanks, the laminate of both suit and restraining gloves all but effortless.  At the meeting of your legs you find the zipper of your catsuit, such a simple means of restricting access that you utterly lack the ability to address.  Instead, at best, you can simply rub your paws against your cunt.

It most certainly wasn’t intended for such use, of course, but cats rarely cared for such things.  Padding over to it, you lean back on your knees, resting your paws upon arm and seat as you position your hips just *so.*

Rounded and somewhat padded, it proves to be a good device to work your cunt against, humping desperately for stimulation.  The friction is there, somewhat, although the smooth material of your laminate catsuit renders most of your effort moot—and quickly you grow tired.  Your corset makes the effort uncomfortable, while the shifting of your hips grinds your buttplug in with every thrust.  Pleasurable, yes, but also frustratingly far from enough.

Eventually you’re forced to retreat, settled back down upon paws and knees, perhaps even *more* wet than when you had begun.  Your uniform made such efforts difficult indeed!

Your paws and suit are so slick as to be almost frictionless, reducing the effect you manage to induce in your pussy.  Like any proper Torean kitten you’re perpetually horny, but your paws simply do not allow you achieve much—indeed it almost proves more frustrating than anything else.

And that’s *before* the shock.  Your collar, linked to sensors in your paw mitts and those of the rainbow stimulators in your womanhood, recognizes exactly what you’re trying to do.  The zap it delivers isn’t particularly painful, but it does shatter even the barest pleasure you were achieving for yourself, as a quite whine escapes your gagged mouth.  

You want to argue, it wasn’t *fair* after all, but you must simply come to terms with the fact that you’re not allowed to touch yourself.  Mistress Royallis forbid it.

A large plastic square is affixed to the side, a smooth semi-rounded surface exposed and directed into the cage itself—Torean-grade laminate shine.  By pressing your paws against it, you can then spread it across your body, a simply but effective means of keeping the material clean.

The laminate that constituted your hood is as tight as any other portion of your uniform, but it was that which covered your head that dehumanized you so effectively.  With only hints of flesh around your eyes its easy to forget there is a human beneath the laminate kitten that is your uniform.  

Working top down you begin with your ears, their flexible material allowing them to be pressed down as you ensure they’re properly shined.  Your actual ears remain hidden as you progress down the sides of your head, over the bridge of your nose, then down to mouth and chin.  The heavy O-ring that kept your teeth apart is obscured by the gag panel across it, leaving you without lips to speak.  Finally there is your collar of course, the red laminate and dainty little bow attached to decoration proving far more silent then the bell, which jingles merrily as your paw brushes up against it.

[[Done!-&gt;CatClean2]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2048" name="CleanChest" tags="" position="3668,41331" size="100,100">Acquiring a fresh bit of shiner from the pad on your cage, you begin working on your torso.  Of course you cannot help but begin with your breasts, the barest hints of stimulation your paws against your chest induces frustratingly tantalizing.  Your diet ensured your curves remained well rounded out, but upon purchase Alexandra had also sent you through a round at the Ministry of Improvements, pushing your measurements to a truly Torean standard.  You’re undeniably busty now, the gloss you apply only underline that fact— as does your corset.

Progressing next to the steel-boned garment hugging your waist so tightly, you realize in that moment you hardly notice what had once been a constant impediment to your movement and breathing.  The corset is strictly tied, the lacing along your back and the busks at the front ensuring you kept measurements as appealing as they are deeply feminine.  And now, thanks to your efforts, the material positively gleams.

The restraints that kept you restrained, tucking your lower leg up against your thighs, also produces crevices into which dirt could hide, not to mention the inevitable effect of laminate rubbing against laminate.  Your paws are bulky too, but you persist, working slowly from your hips down.

(if: $Clean is false)[Of course you focus primarily on your inner thighs however, removing the streaks of your own desire with each pass of your paw.  The simply glossy shine of your uniform is soon returned, although somewhere along the way you find yourself lingering at the meeting of your thighs, your shine-laced paw pressing against your womanhood beneath.  A gentle shock from your collar serves to startle you out of the reverie, however.

You end on your feet, tucked up as they are just beneath your buttocks.  You’re one of the rare slaves on Torei not forced into constant high heel use, but that’s only because you are restricted to your knees anyway.

Eventually you place your hands upon the arm of the couch, allowing you to look over and down upon the gleaming object you had sighted from below.  It appears to be a control device of some kind, the reflection coming from its metallic luster, while rows of buttons indicate some sort of functionality.  

You dare not even *consider* it, but could this be a control mechanism for your rainbow system?  The buttons are not labeled, but the largest certainly calls to you, its bright green coloration the same color your indicator LEDs used just before dumping pleasure into your cunt and nipples!

You will need to knock the control from the table though, down onto the ground, to explore it further.

Unfortunately its follow moments later by the table’s other guest, the red vase you had seen from below.  Your swipe had shifted the table just enough to unbalance it, sending it to the ground with a sudden and ominous clatter.  Looking down, you see it has broken in two.

Scrambling to turn it back off, lest the sound draw attention, you’re left afterward in the silence of your own disappointment.

The mere touch leaves you panting, your loins aching for more, and yet cruelly he chooses then to stand with a rueful smile.

Yours is altered with hormonal boosters that kept your sexual drive operating at Torean levels, or what anyone from the universe beyond would call embarrassingly high.

Most slaves subsisted solely on such feed, the carefully composed recipe providing a day’s worth of nutrients, as well as your necessary liquid intake, in a form your owner at least could deem “convenient.”

Going down heavy, you can already feel that warm burn of the hormonal supplements beginning their work.

If you were hoping for more information on yourself, or even just an existent extranet connection, you’re sorely disappointed.  You recall that Torei largely operated outside of the galactic information network, and that was ignoring the significant delays and cost such communication demanded given the remoteness of the system.  As to the device in your hand, it appears to have been recently wiped clean.  The only non-standard file on the system appears to be a copy of “The Blagger’s Guide to Torei,” automatically installed while connected to the local network.

*We may have as yet failed to find other sentient life in the abyssal reaches of space, but variations do exist among us humans, and the planet Torei’s particular history is no exception.  One needs only walk down the street to recognize the most immediate peculiarity of the Torean people, and that is the predominance of women.  Official population counts put the male to female ration at 1-to-10, a rate achieved largely to their natural physiology.*

*Torean men are Haploid, while Torean women are Diploid.  As we do not expect the average reader to have focused all that much in biology class, in short this means that sexual intercourse between men and women always produce a female child.  In turn, if a women goes without fertilization in this manner, she will eventually give birth to a male child (over a far longer period of time, and if birth control is not utilized, which gets into biomedical topics that could fill a thousand other entries).  This also means that Torean men do not have fathers, and are instead inheriting genetically from their mother’s fathers (thus their grandfathers.)*

*Confused yet?  Bumblebees (which incidentally like most insects are not found on Torei) reproduce in a similar manner, and that hive-like structure may best explain WHY this occurs.  For that, one must look to the progenitors of Torean civilization, their eternal polar AIs…*

*The planet Torei is renowned for its biomedical capabilities, but of more interest for many is how that intersects with cultural tendencies towards gender.  It is true that men are generally seen more favorably planetside, if only because they are rarer, and thus more predisposed towards wealth.  One would perhaps think that imbalance leads to strict limitations on gender, but the truth is far different indeed.*

*Transitioning between genders is relatively easy (if expensive) on Torei, for offworlders one needs only reach the planet and book an appointment (or several, depending on the breadth of said transition) with the Ministry of Improvements.  Male-to-female changes are straightforward, capable of even achieving reproductive capability if Torean physiology is adopted, but prospective patients should be wary: Torean laws apply far differently towards women, and registration with the Ministry of Wombs should not be taken lightly.  Few Toreans utilize this procedure however, as male slaves are far more valuable, and free males rarely wish to relinquish any bit of their power.  Female-to-male changes are similar in cost, but the with added economic consideration that any additional value earned from joining the relatively rare ranks of men on the planet is generally offset by the cost of the procedure in the first place.*

*Comparable to nation-states, Ringdoms are the foundational political unit that dominate the largely habitable ring around equatorial Torei.  Despite the name they do indeed come in all manner of shapes and sizes, along with an equally myriad variation in government types.  Kingdoms, republics, theocracies, and commonwealths, as well as everything in between run from what’s called the “Mountainous” region surrounding the singular Space Elevator, and the Antipodes, the region on the far side of the planet.

Talking in generalities about Ringdoms is always dangerous, but one can at least say that those nearest the space elevator are the most familiar in manner to offworlders and travelers.  Galactic-level amenities are common, representation with offworld trade groups can provide some manner of diplomatic protection, and local governments are generally progressive (at least by Torean standards).  In turn, the Antipodes are often fiercely traditional, with technological adoption varying widely.  

The Ringdom of Aekora, in which you now stand, is in the Mountainous region, but does not abut the space elevator directly.  It is a Diarchy, ruled by a pair of Diarchs elected to the positions.  While technically open to any Torean-born Aekoran citizen, in practice these positions have split between the richest two families in the Ringdom—the Naram-Sin, and the Sargon.*

Few Toreans utilize this procedure however, as male slaves are far more valuable, and free males rarely wish to relinquish any bit of their power.  Female-to-male changes are similar in cost, but the with added economic consideration that any additional value earned from joining the relatively rare ranks of men on the planet is generally offset by the cost of the procedure in the first place.*

*Comparable to nation-states, Ringdoms are the foundational political unit that dominate the largely habitable ring around equatorial Torei.  Despite the name they do indeed come in all manner of shapes and sizes, along with an equally myriad variation in government types.  Kingdoms, republics, theocracies, and commonwealths, as well as everything in between run from what’s called the “Mountainous” region surrounding the singular Space Elevator, and the Antipodes, the region on the far side of the planet.

Talking in generalities about Ringdoms is always dangerous, but one can at least say that those nearest the space elevator are the most familiar in manner to offworlders and travelers.  Galactic-level amenities are common, representation with offworld trade groups can provide some manner of diplomatic protection, and local governments are generally progressive (at least by Torean standards).  In turn, the Antipodes are often fiercely traditional, with technological adoption varying widely.  

The Ringdom of Aekora, in which you now stand, is in the Mountainous region, but does not abut the space elevator directly.  It is a Diarchy, ruled by a pair of Diarchs elected to the positions.  While technically open to any Torean-born Aekoran citizen, in practice these positions have split between the richest two families in the Ringdom—the Naram-Sin, and the Sargon.*

This empire, known only to history as “The Laminate Culture” or “The Lamination People” because of the style of clothing they produced, saw the end of expansion within the Milky Way before most of the rest of us had. Due to coincidences in the angular momentum of outer-spiral stars, they were hedged in by strong nations they had a tense yet stable peace with. They needed someplace to grow, but didn’t dare move in on any of the stars in their neighborhood.

And so an ingenious yet barmy plan was hatched to send colonists to the Andromeda galaxy. The plan was to settle those stars with Laminate Culture colonies early, and spread outward through that galaxy before anyone else had managed to start an expedition. To their credit, they thought long-term: the journey would take a thousand years, and they’d have no way of ferrying wealth from these new stars to the motherworld. This was a very very long game, and it took a special kind of desperation to even want to play it.

You can’t send a live crew on a thousand-year journey that never comes close to any stars. A generation-ship would need more fuel for life support on such a journey than it would for deceleration. The fleet they designed was effectively a big dumb intergalactic comet: machinery and gene banks and artificial intelligences wrapped in a giant geode of protective minerals and ice. Everything would just sit off and safe and inert until it came near the energy of a star again.

[[Return to the index.-&gt;Guide]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2083" name="OffCourse" tags="" position="1605,6572" size="100,100">Of course, as you can all guess now, this little spore never made it to Andromeda. Stories differ on what happened to it. Some say that the geode craft had some sort of purely analog course-correcting device that locked onto a stray stellar cluster in intergalactic space. Others say that something went wrong, and emergency systems woke to active mode and changed the ship’s course. The more fanciful tales tell of signals sent from the Milky Way to sabotage the project by changing the objectives.

Whatever the reason, the ship took a rendez-vous course that brought it to a stable orbit around the most suitable of a handful of lonely stars stuck like an island out in the nowhere between the galaxies. The light of this star melted the geode and woke up the machines, who began building factories and supply lines to construct a suitable habitat for the colony.

As I’ve mentioned before, the amount of planning that went into this project is breathtaking. The original implementors hadn’t considered their payload would get mired in this backwater, but they’d designed the construction phase to bootstrap itself even in harsh conditions. Simple machines built factories that spat out more complicated machines that built more factories to make even better machines. This process continued until at least three of the AIs in the fleet had been augmented enough to begin the next phase.

[[Return to the index.-&gt;Guide]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2084" name="BuildHab" tags="" position="1755,6572" size="100,100">Once the brains were awake, it was time to build a home for organic life. None of the planets in the cluster were likely globes, so the machines took a rocky ball on the edge of the Goldilocks zone and launched all the chunks of ice and carbonaceous chondrite they could find. If you think the timescale for the original mission was long, well the AIs had near-infinite patience. Piece by piece over tens of thousands of years, they built up a planet from dry stone into something that could support life.

Machines around the various stars in the cluster lensed starlight to knock matter out of stable orbits and off toward the new planet. I’ve been on expedition, and seen the lens devices with my own eyes. They’re impressive machines, like vast engines of war from our distant and more violent past. I’m told they still work, if the AIs ever want to use them again.

The planet’s new crust slowly cooled around the freshly molten core, and this is where the Torei we know today began. The machines set down at the two poles and dug intricate tunnels through to the hot mantle beneath, making impossibly complicated fractal corkscrew patterns. Through coriolis forces, heat, pressure and other simple physics the magma was separated out into component elements useful for generating an atmosphere.

The machines built tetrahedral “caps” of sorts atop the vents from these tunnels, and did all of the final distillation and synthesis in them. These pyramids are apparently still there inside the current-day ziggurats. The real machinery for atmospheric generation descends down into the network of tunnels, but there is a hollow space inside the zigs where the caps can be seen.

Ah, I suppose you all have the famous image of the Dahom ziggurat in the snow. Well imagine that landscape with no snow yet, because the air was too dry. Now imagine that the vast stepped pyramid is only one-twentieth the size, and smooth-sided. That’s how they got started. Those little pyramids worked tirelessly for centuries to generate an atmosphere suitable for garden crops and large mammals.

The ziggurats at Mazos and Dahom were built later, and we have hints that they were an act of desperation. We think that the AIs realized that they weren’t making enough progress on a self-sustaining biosphere. They created the zigs as habitat domes with the hopes that human workers could help speed up the project.

[[Return to the index.-&gt;Guide]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2085" name="FirstHumans" tags="" position="1905,6572" size="100,100">If that was the plan, then it worked. The first humans probably awoke inside the bottom level of one of the zigs, before they built the upper layers. They’d have had hydroponic gardens already running to give them fresh food and filtered water. There would have been some livestock, but likely no birds because the air wouldn’t have been clean enough for them yet.

Life for these first few generations was probably pretty miserable, even by what we see at the Torean poles today. The AIs were still completing their program of habitat creation, and to them the humans were little more than lab rats and plough-mares. The ziggurat was a castle of horrors full of biological experimentation and vat-grown chimeras. We think that this work resulted in tissue cultures that are still alive as membranes inside the atmosphere generators today.

This period when Torean humans lived only inside the ziggurats is somewhat hard to pin down, historically. Most of what we have is myth from the humans and propaganda from the AIs, so who knows what to believe. All we can really say is that this period marked the development of the current social system at the poles.

[[Return to the index.-&gt;Guide]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2086" name="Husbandry" tags="" position="2055,6572" size="100,100">The goal of the AIs was to make Torei habitable for normal humans, but the death rate among the early populations was too high. The bio-engineering research program produced humans who were more durable, and could withstand more of the half-made world. Specialized organisms were seeded at the equator, to try and build up biomass where the conditions were most favorable. Life on Torei began slowly to step outside, but it was all strange new breeds meant specifically for that world.

Since this was a breeding program, the human genotype was altered to produce nine females for every male. The reproductive systems and sexual drives of these humans were cranked up to unusual levels for maximal fertility. Each man would impregnate one woman per month, like clockwork. The population grew and new levels were built to make the ziggurats we know today.

Controlling such a population was not the same task as it had been before. During each pole’s summer, when the sun did not set, humans were let out onto the planet’s surface in laminate environment suits. These were an early form of today’s isolation laminates that the Emissaries wear, and they did far less. The wearer was protected from the unfinished atmosphere outside, and infosystems in the helmet kept the AI in control of what the occupant saw and heard.

What originally started as an environment suit for humans being let outside soon became a population control mechanism. A misbehaving colonist could be locked into one of these suits and made to act as an internal police force. The suits could simulate almost any sensation to the wearer’s flesh, which made it an efficient system for re-training.

The colonists’ ramped-up sex drive and lack of almost any other means of entertainment meant that the AIs had a convenient reward system. Pain is always an effective punishment, but the AIs learned how to prey on a person’s fears and desires. What we’ve seen in the present day suggests that even a limited time in the isolation suits completely changes a person. And this was important, because if the AIs were going to start actual farms on the equator, they’d need to be able to trust the farmers.

[[Return to the index.-&gt;Guide]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2087" name="Farmers" tags="" position="2207,6572" size="100,100">I’m not a geologist, but even I am stunned by the dramatic difference between the equatorial band and the rest of Torei. You can drive around in the badlands for days without seeing anything but igneous and metamorphic rocks. You joyride down dusty craters, follow fissures down tectonic thrusts, and then suddenly out of nowhere everything is covered in lichen.

If you turn in the direction of the blooms, you start to see little green shoots in the dusty cracks, here and there. Plants with long taproots extend fernlike fronds up to the daylight. And as you continue, within only a short time you find yourself on a dirt-like surface driving through low scrub. You can tell your latitude to a novel degree of accuracy simply by looking at vegetation around you. There’s a reason the planet’s flag has that green belt around the globe.

What’s also interesting is when you dig down through equatorial soil. The topsoil itself is very thin, but well-managed as a sort of sacred trust. But once you lift that off, you find caustic stuff that could make for devastating dust storms if allowed to become airborne. Early farms were planted just to control this layer of atmospheric fallout and keep it buried where it wouldn’t be a problem any more. Ask a Pembric plantation master about “leechcorn” some time, and you’ll get an amazing education in bioremediation techniques!

The farms were a success, in small part thanks to the controlled watering the equator gets. The AIs control underground aquifers via long tunnels that are off limits to most humans. When it’s time for crop watering, they engineer rain showers that bathe a portion of the equatorial region. It’s run like clockwork, and typically during the evening. You sometimes see the rain schedule next to the train timetables, for example.

At this point, the habitat creation project sadly stalled. The AIs needed the farms to supply its biotech machines with ingredients, and the humans needed the AIs to keep the rain falling and the air flowing. As one of the old poems put it (and apologies for my somewhat unskilled translation): “And the Dæmons kept dominion of the sky, and Men claimed dominion of the land.”

[[Return to the index.-&gt;Guide]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2088" name="Sharecrop" tags="" position="2355,6572" size="100,100">Of course, the “Dæmons” kept dominion over the humans, as well. The end of expansion on Torei meant that there weren’t enough isolation suits for all of the troublemakers, but the ones that were bound in them made effective police for the rest. Well, at least for a while, anyway.

The problem with releasing an incredibly randy and fertile population to the furthest corner of a planet from your control is that your carefully controlled breeding program will go wildly off course. It didn’t take many generations for the natural-born humans at the equator to see the isolates as foreign oppressors and set plans to overthrow them. This begins what is possibly the bloodiest time in Torei’s history, which Toreologists have come to call the Sharecropping Wars.

At first, the AIs saw this population as expendable, and simply eradicated whole towns when it encountered trouble. There were usually enough people inside the ziggurats who were willing to colonize an evacuated farmstead and live out under the Torean sun. But eventually the costs of this became clear to both sides.

The exterminations and re-population efforts brought more and more humans over to the revolutionary side. Furthermore, the rebel humans had taken to destroying the crops that were destined for the ziggurats. A human colony could survive on tubers and ruminant milk for a year if they had to, but a critical missed shipment of seed oils or other organic chemical ingredients could mean trouble for the whole planet. Time and again, the humans showed the AIs that they were willing to ignore the threat of ecological disaster in pursuit of independence.

This is something that seems predictable to you or I, but the AIs genuinely seemed to have trouble accepting it. They kept up their program of recolonization for over a century before finally recognizing the equatorial ring as independent. Now the “Dæmons” became “Emissaries”, and they negotated air and water rights in exchange for necessary crops. They traded technology for the food needed to keep the population in the ziggurats alive.

From this point on, aside from the occasional nation that tested the AIs’ wrath or surrendered sovereignty to one of the Emissaries, the political role of the AIs remained in this stalemate nearly into the present day. For a thousand years, humanity was able to build its own society on the equator, and the “ringdoms” as we now call them were formed.

[[Return to the index.-&gt;Guide]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2089" name="FreeHuman" tags="" position="2505,6572" size="100,100">The politics get boring for a while here, but wars are now waged between the ringdoms more often. Alliances form, nations conquer other nations, and realms are partitioned up for heirs who then fight one another. Throughout all of this, the threat of interference by the AIs looms.

It’s not really useful as a scholarly classification, but I find it’s easiest to describe this period to people as feudal. The culture was based heavily on male inheritance of arable land, and conduct of war was often regulated by the AIs. Commonly, when a dispute between ringdoms broke out, war would be a last resort after bringing the case to an Emissary.

The art from this period often depicts the AIs as turbulent gods, bringing bounty and destruction on ineffable whims. The laws of men could be appealed to an Emissary, but the result would sometimes leave everyone suffering. Humanity wrestled with its relationship to the AIs, hating and fearing and ultimately relying on them even in independence.

For a time, a class of priestesses emerged, promising to interpret the “Dæmons” for their masters. The story goes that an Isolate raped the women of a powerful landlord, to threaten the legitimacy of any heirs. The daughters of these unions were believed to have insight into the AIs, and allegedly they were seen talking to their biological father (a difficult claim to prove, as all male Isolates effectively look the same). These women were ejected from the estate their mothers belonged to, and began prophesying in the streets on market days. Their prescience became legendary, and soon it became common for stray women to claim insight into the plans of the AIs.

This trend improved the lot of unowned women immensely over the years. Originally the term “freewomb” meant a woman whose children were not by her owner, but the word soon came to mean the children themselves. Cast out of an estate, these girls had to make their way alone in societies that did not consciously value the roles they could play. A lack of loyalties made them neutral mediators, taking over some of the roles that the Emissaries had performed before independence. But the association with Dæmon-scrying proved devastating.

[[Return to the index.-&gt;Guide]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2090" name="PrinceThrall" tags="" position="2655,6572" size="100,100">There are Toreologists who spend their whole careers studying just one period for one house of one nation during the warring states era. Land and loyalties switched around like plains rivers during a storm, but a stalemate between five remaining ringdoms held off unification for three generations. The details of this struggle make up much of the high art on Torei, and people sometimes identify culturally by which of the five empires they descend from rather than which of the current ringdoms they currently live.

There was a courtesan named Theca or Nebla (depending on the language of the tale), and the emperor of Falon made a grand present of her to the emperor of Prellatia. This gift was part of a court gesture of great magnitude, but war demanded the Falonian emperor’s attention at the home front. So he locked her into Falon’s symbols of state (scepter, crown, and boots) and sent her along with an escort formed of his most trusted palace guards. He would be present in a ceremonial sense, and would arrive in person later to wear the diadem once more.

By the time Theca reached Prellatia, the war in Falon had claimed the lives of the four emperors. The Prellatian emperor gloated, and tried to take the crown from Theca’s head. Her guards dispatched this ruler expertly, and in a legendary battle managed to hold the Prellatian palace.

There were further battles, but within a year all of the noble houses on Torei were swayed by Theca’s calls for peace. She was but a slave, yet she wore the Falonian and Prellation crowns. She seduced hundreds of powerful men who came to her court, and each man felt he owned a piece of her. The planet was tired of war, and Theca offered a new model for human self-rule.

In a coronation ceremony that is the subject of all the great murals and hangings on Torei, she bound herself with circlets made from the crowns of the five empires: one on each ankle, one on each wrist, and Falon’s about her throat. The remaining symbols of state were made into a multi-colored chain that kept her locked to the throne for the rest of her life. Torei now knew life without war for the first time since it had settled the equator.

[[Return to the index.-&gt;Guide]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2091" name="PolarRelations" tags="" position="2805,6572" size="100,100">With the ringdoms no longer fractured, the need for Emissary intervention or alliances with the poles almost vanished overnight. People worried what the Dæmons would do at first, but soon forgot their fears: the rains kept coming on schedule and no waves of slick black bodies descended on their habitations.

The polar AIs, for their part, seemed to enjoy this era of peace. Without war to sap resources, the cost of equatorial goods went down. They exported fewer engines of war and more agricultural and lifestyle goods. The peace dividend seemed to pay out to everyone.

Unfortunately, the freewombs on the streets suffered terribly. With a culture no longer nervous about the mood of the polar Dæmons, they soon found themselves scapegoats for all kinds of problems. During the Princess Thrall’s rule, the ruling houses enacted hundreds of strict laws governing their lives. Many sought enslavement in poor houses to escape persecution, but most soldiered on in the oppressive regime.

After the death of the Princess Thrall, the Council of Regents continued to meet and honor the peace for some time. One woman would be offered up from each of the original five empires per year, and chained to the throne as a group. Many of the festival queens you see today are inspired by this tradition.

[[Return to the index.-&gt;Guide]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2092" name="Dissolution" tags="" position="2955,6572" size="100,100">With human society stable and peaceful, it was only a matter of time before revolutionary thinking cropped up again. This time it was more of a nationalist flavor. In the time since the wars, local cultures had a chance to flourish. Language was largely uniform thanks to the AIs’ influence on communication, but customs and traditions gave people a national identity that they wanted to see reflected.

Over the next two centuries, local independence movements chipped away at the authority of the Council of Regents. Some set up their own copies of the Council, claiming authority over all of Torei. Some brought in polar Emissaries and boasted that they’d bring back the heroic age that had settled their land. In all, the Regents were as tone-deaf as the AIs had been, and they responded to uprisings with brutality.

Once the dust settled, the rough borders of modern Torei were laid down. One can look at a map of Torei from three hundred years ago and still identify almost all of the nations based on a modern atlas. Unity was gone, but trade struggles replaced war as the means for jockeying among the ringdoms. The AIs had become experts at the use of political economy to control the human settlements, as the ringdoms weren’t so eager to sacrifice quality of life once they’d re-gained stability.

And who knows where Torei would have gone if this had been allowed to continue?

[[Return to the index.-&gt;Guide]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2093" name="Discvoer" tags="" position="3105,6572" size="100,100">All the guidebooks tell you, Cmdr. Stave Fedman was the first human from mainstream intergalactic civilization to visit Torei. While it’s true that he was the first to join Torei and the rest of humanity in contact, there is ample evidence that others discovered Torei’s stars long before this.

We have records of a pirate fleet from the early days of Andromedan colonization. The logs hint of a “cache of starrs(sic)” where their plundered booty could be staged far from intergalactic jump points. Some micro-asteroids found around other stars in Torei’s cluster are believed to be wreckage from an orbital battle, but little conclusive evidence has been collected.

The AIs themselves have marked certain ravines and cave systems on Torei as off-limits to humanity. Some of the more creative analysis of long-range reconnaissance hints at a structure shaped rather like the hull of a long-space frigate of the sort used five thousand years ago. It’s sketchy at best, but it’s at least somewhat corroborated by faint burn marks on the surface rock when the regolith layer is cleared by wind.

At any rate, Torean humans themselves had no contact with the outside world until Commander Fedman’s expedition. Torei’s cluster had been known since regular passage to Andromeda had opened up, but the cost of visiting it hadn’t been justifiable. Once the cost of habitable land in the Milky Way had climbed back up and the technology for space travel had advanced enough, it was only a matter of time before someone visited each little isolated star out in intergalactic space hoping for a homestead.

Fedman’s diaries were cleaned up for the official record, but at least three versions claiming to be the originals can be found in bookshops all over Torei. Each one tells a slightly different tale of the debauchery and revelling he engaged in on his visit, but they’re all really based on interviews with his crew.

[[Return to the index.-&gt;Guide]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2094" name="ORTrade" tags="" position="3255,6572" size="100,100">The ringdoms built landing pads to attract visiting ships, but all of the orbital infrastructure was controlled by the AIs. Voidcraft would stay in a solar orbit for ages before being permitted to even approach a Torean orbit. The AIs vetted and quarantined visitors fastidiously. When a ship was allowed to the surface, the humans paid top prices for any cargo aboard.

At first, the humans bartered: the AIs had spent tens of thousands of years perfecting genetic manipulation and biotechnology as part of the habitat creation project, and Torei had the capacity for medical services unavailable anywhere else in the cosmos. Eventually all of the nations were able to trade in common currency, and word started to get out that they paid handsomely for certain cargoes.

A flotilla of rough trading ships sat idle in orbit of Torei’s star, each waiting for permission from the Dæmon Dockmasters to land. From time to time a chaff-runner would make an attempt at unauthorized landing, and some would succeed. The AIs dutifully broadcast the registration IDs of all impounded vessels, and there are some downright chilling recordings from the captured pilots who claimed to have “defected” to Dahom or Mazos.

In retrospect it’s obvious why the AIs were so picky, but at the time they seemed as mysterious to us as they did to the Torean humans. The AIs were still pulling the strings of the human economy, and wanted a surplus in goods needed at the ziggurats and a defecit of items needed at the equator. So generally a lot of food and water and hydrocarbon mixtures made it through, while processed goods and technology stayed in orbit.

[[Return to the index.-&gt;Guide]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2095" name="Gunboat" tags="" position="3405,6572" size="100,100">Unfortunately for the AIs, it was the manufacturers of technology and processed goods that had the strongest space forces. The Zanweg Cartel sent an armada directly into Torean geosynchronous orbit and began to lower a tether to the peak of the highest mountain on Torei’s equator. With fighter escorts running interference swarm patterns around the tether, a full-scale orbital lift was built along it’s length.

The space elevator on Torei changed everything. The mountain it was built on was not very high, but it never had a chance to build up any soil layer of note. It had been disputed territory for centuries, and several ringdoms that abutted it considered it a national treasure. Once the base anchor port was completed, the borders were formalized and the tower was declared a neutral intergalactic trade zone, and all ringdoms on that side of the planet were granted access corridors to the base.

Once trade in industrial goods opened up, the neighboring ringdoms were able to build vast tower arcologies around the planetside port spire. The more wealthy nations were able to build skybridges to the orbital lift tower from the tops of their own structures. It’s a common for a vast city to spring up around one of these, but Torei has over a dozen!

I said this was unfortunate for the AIs, and it really was. The economy has swung out of their control, and the habitat-creation project is seriously compromised by this. If the planet never becomes self-sustaining, they may resort to force once more. It remains to be seen how well Mazos and Dahom adapt to this new reality. They’ve been slow to change before, probably because a biosphere-building project requires a very patient long-term mindset, and they seem to treat the human economy as yet another ecological system.

The AIs could outclass them on the last one, if they ever decided to. Of course, it could lead to their biotech secrets getting out, which would ruin any advantage they have.

The AIs have always held control over the badlands, but they appear to be stepping up their game lately. Word is that they’re losing population and have to spend more and more of their resources sending Emissaries further and further afield. The unrest at the poles is helped by agitator-liberator groups that run a sort of underground railroad to help people flee to the ringdoms.

One of the reasons the AIs are stretched thin is that they’ve begun to maintain a space fleet. It’s a rag-tag collection of used and commandeered vessels, but they’ve been spotted at ports in three galaxies. They may be trying to export their services, and they seem to buy exactly the same things they’ve always needed.

And of course Torean expansion to other stars was always part of their mandate. The Dockmaster is largely silent, and only issues quarantine orders from time to time. It could be busy managing the polar fleets and preparing for conquest. We just have no way of knowing.

It takes you a moment, a *long* moment, to recognize the raven-haired woman who strides confidently through the door.  Even then you cannot bring yourself to believe it, not until the secretarial slave asks her name, and she responds.

“Corinth Sylvette.”

The last few months at the Academy had seen you transformed, adapting to your new role upon Torei, and the same seems true for Corinth—in a most spectacular fashion.  Your memories may still be less than whole, but the woman who approaches your cage after signing off with the secretary very much looks the part of a Torean Mistress, with little of the Corinth you remember.  Tall knee high stiletto heels add an imperious snap to every step she takes, while the laminate one piece she wore seemed to demand attention, even if the long coat of a similar midnight color kept her dignity. Even her crimson-painted lips seem to dictate, not merely speak the word that emerges as greeting.

“Hey.”  It hangs in the air between you, filling further and further with your apprehension.  Yet then she smiles, relaxing just a bit, and there the Corinth you remember spills out from the mask of the steely Mistress.  Not a disguise, you conclude, but a new Corinth.  Lost and reveling in the wonders of Torei.

“Try not to stare *too* much,” she teases, still holding that smile.  “And get on your knees,  uh, *slave*.”

[[“You look so different!&quot;-&gt;CorEnd4Oops]]
[[“…yes, Mistress.”-&gt;CorEnd4]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2101" name="CorEnd4Oops" tags="" position="4328,39539" size="100,100">The smoky makeup around her eyes makes the shifting of her brows, furrowing a bit in legitimate displeasure, all the more obvious.  “There will be time to talk, but you must remember your place.  *On your knees.*”

She does not sound liable to ask nicely again.

[[“…yes, Mistress.”-&gt;CorEnd4]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2102" name="CorEnd4" tags="" position="4474,39538" size="100,100">Moving to your knees, spreading your legs and bowing your head as you had been taught, Corinth opens the cell door.  She seems even taller as she stands above you, brushing a bit of your hair away from your shoulders.  Reaching to her purse she produces a black circlet of what your furtitive glances first presume to be laminate, but the weight with which she handles it suggests a steel core at the very least.  You realize the intention immediately.  A collar.  *Your* new collar.
(set: $Inv to (a:))
(if: $CorOverride is true)[“Seems our little plan went perfectly,](else:)[“I just knew you would be listed for auction eventually,]” she asserts.  “Even so… it is a bit hard to believe this is where we are, huh?  I certainly never thought I would cash out from our, well former, employer.  Stay on Torei.  But… mhm, I did, didn’t I?”

She lowers the collar, lining it up with your throat as much as allowing you to examine it closer.  It is indeed coated in a thin aesthetic layer of laminate, yet with careful engraving that allowed the silver of the steel beneath to shine through, spelling out a short statement: *Property of Mistress Sylvette.*

Pressing the collar forward, it comes up against your throat, momentarily cold before your own body heat seeps through laminate and steel alike.  With a quiet, but so very final feeling **click** the hidden mag-lock behind engages and Corinth can pull away.  Your collar remains, its tight embrace providing an eternal reminder of your place on Torei now.  That of a slave, owned by the Mistress above you.

To the collar a short length of chain is then attached, a leash, which Corinth tugs to bring you to your feet.  “Let’s get out of here, yeah?  We don’t need to hurry, but we also shouldn’t just waste time hanging about the market.  I setup dinner reservations for us, to celebrate the new… relationship, between us.  But before that we have to make your appointment, at the Ministry of Improvements.”

Already she’s pulling you along, into the warren of hallways that made up the Prime Market’s slave pens.  “We can talk things over at dinner.”

There are so many ways to improve a slave, and the Ministry is so inexpensive for many procedures so it just makes sense, you know?  Nothing too dramatic, so no need to worry.  Just going to fill out your measurements a bit, bust and hips, thighs too.  Have your tracking chip updated with my credentials, a set of rainbow controls, adjust your gag reflex… hm, ah!  The most important part!”

Looking over her shoulder, she winks.  “I have a thing for red-heads, so… get ready for *that.*”

It’s rhetorical, you lost your right to decide months back after all.  And much like your time at the Academy the next few hours pass quickly, even if you’re rendered unconscious for some of them.  The Ministry of Improvements, your submission to the waiting Lancers there… it all passes in a blur.

You should know better than most how easily it is for a freewomb to find herself in a collar, hm?”

“Hey—babe, did you hear me?”

You snap back to reality with a bit of a start, recalling where you are.  Club Lush, at one of the private tables in the VIP section above the general dance floor.  Corinth’s dinner date, as planned, your visit to the Ministry of Improvements already completed.  

Glancing down, you take in the dress Corinth had picked for you—a long laminate ensemble matched with gloves and heels.  Laminate thinwear even provided for your sheer stockings.  Of course your collar remained as well, as tight as ever, but she had accessorized it as well by utilizing the hardpoints on the side for a set of short laminate straps.  It may be absent for the time, but affixing a gag of some sort would take only moments.

“I was saying you may drop protocol,” your date, and owner, explains over a charming smile from her seat across the table.  She too had utilized a wardrobe, acquiring a corset.  Her coat remained as well, but was seated on the curve of the small booth between you both.  “You may ask any question you like.  I’m sure you have plenty.”

Your Mistress takes a sip of her drink, a bright infusion of blue that reflects brightly off the laminate covering her chest.  She seems to notice where your gaze had fallen, grinning as she nods. 

“Ask away.”

And you know the saying: dress for success, right?  Truant Officers and other bothersome people here don’t often bother someone who looks one,” she counts off her finger, “Torean and two, like she means business.”

That last line is delivered with sudden fearsomeness, your widened eyes earning a second laugh from the Mistress.  “And, you know, there was you to consider.  If I was going to make a serious attempt to go after you, to do this… whole thing, I felt I had to earn the *right* to own a slave.  Look the part, be the part, that sort of thing.”

Otherwise its not out of reach for most who live on this planet to own at least one slave, there are just so many collared girls—and the occasional man, available.”

She shrugs.  “Point is, I got the one I wanted.  And your time at the Academy ensures you’re useful to me immediately, if we’re looking at it from a less… romantic view.  In a few years I hope to own at least a half dozen collared girls.”

Decided to stay in Aekora because you would be auctioned here, but also its just cheaper than the Ringdoms right up against the Way Up.”

Swirling her drink a bit, she takes a sip before continuing.  “It came with all the peculiar Torean bits too.  You know, d-rings and hardpoints around the bed frame, suspension fittings on some parts of the ceiling…” she winks.  “The fun stuff.”

The material is as glossy and tight as any other you’ve worn upon Torei, but it’s the way you fill it out that feels so remarkably different.  

The Ministry of Improvements had made several changes to you, adding to the work done during your time at the Academy, as requested by your so newly established Mistress.  You had been a bit on the lean side upon arriving on Torei, months ago, but now your curves press against the laminate readily.  At chest and hips your measurements have been adjusted towards the bountiful norm that Torei—and most men you had ever met—seemed to prefer.  Even without a corset your waist presents a nicely tapered look as well, only adding to the effect.  

It’s harder to observe, but a glance towards any mirror would reveal your hair to be a bright and insistent red now—the color as bold as it is now natural, the Ministry’s work going further then simply dyes.  Below the neck you’ve been denuded of hair, although that matched galactic sensibilities as much as Torean ones.  

Yet its something *else* that had drawn your attention downward in the first place, a trembling sensation of… aching desire, far stronger than you had ever known, between your legs.  You’re dressed in laminate, collared at the throat, but you should not be *this* horny.

Across the table, Corinth tips her head curiously.  “Problem?”

Well, helps sell the look.  Torean Mistress, and whatnot.  But they’re actually quite useful, it turns out.  My set here has a projected HUD, allows me to monitor things… I used it to great effect at the auction, obviously.”

You’ve already demonstrated you’re not… all that great at being a freewomb, hm?”

She doesn’t sound angry, or mocking, but simply takes a firm expression.  Given her makeover, the black hair and crimson lips do much to strip any arguments from your tongue.  Your time at the Academy provides the rest, the training they had drilled into you shining through.  

“So, now that we have that established, what does your collar *mean*?”  Corinth asks again.

But I intend it to mean the same between us.  You will observe slave protocol, and I will be your Mistress.”

She smiles at that last word, clearly enjoying the title.  Even so, her lips purse together afterward, as she looks to you even more intently.  “But we never established what exactly our… relationship is, have we?  (if: $CorOverride is true)[We talked about my owning you, of course.  But not the specifics.](else:)[By the time I decided to attempt to buy you, you were already enslaved to the Academy.

The question seems deeply important to her.

[[“I always felt there was… something between us, Corinth.”-&gt;CorALove]]

She seems to mull them over, chewing on each syllable.  “We never really discussed what that would *mean*.  For us, I mean.  The relationship.  I’ve had a lot of time to think about it, though.  Since you went away to the Academy, I mean.  Which we will get to in a second.”

Placing both hands upon the table between you, she smiles brightly, yet her eyes are intense—domineering even.  “Before we do, you need to tell me what you are.  You need to say.”

[[“I’m… your property.”-&gt;CorAskProp]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2127" name="CorBasic" tags="" position="5225,40643" size="100,100">Corinth’s lips pull together tightly, her eyebrows rising with a hint of surprise and consternation.  “Well… that’s understandable, I suppose.”

Her disappointment fades, replaced by a look you had often seen from the Academy’s Headmistress—generally right before you were told to do something, regardless of your thoughts on the matter.

“I’ll treat you as my slave, going forward.  As simply as that.  You were trained at the Academy in the role of a generic concubine, and that will fit my needs perfectly.  I intend to use you as my sex slave, after all.”

The way she says it, so nonchalantly, is perhaps the best indicator that Corinth had truly adapted to Torei’s culture.  You’re in public, the occasional patron of Club Lush walking by, but she does nothing to lower her voice, or obscure her intentions.  Corinth had always worn her feelings on her shoulder, and she wasn’t about to stop now.

Even before you started coming to Torei, when we worked together… but I never had the confidence to ever be direct about it, you know?  Staying here on Torei, working to become a Mistress certainly changed that at least!  And now I *own* you.”

The mere thought seems to enthuse her, almost to the point of giggling from sheer pleasure.  But she retains control of herself, brushing a bit of hair from her eyes as she reasserts herself.

“If that’s how you feel, I think you will like what I had planned.  I’ll treat you as my slave, going forward.  As simply as that.  You were trained at the Academy in the role of a generic concubine, and that will fit my needs perfectly.  I intend to use you as my sex slave, after all.”

The way she says it, so nonchalantly, is perhaps the best indicator that Corinth had truly adapted to Torei’s culture.  You’re in public, the occasional patron of Club Lush walking by, but she does nothing to lower her voice, or obscure her intentions.

I expect you to be submissive and dutiful, always minding your manners.  You must recognize that you are now property.  *My* property.  I intend to keep you bound in most circumstances, and of course you will be wearing laminate only going forward.  Textiles are far too expensive to import, and I very much like the way you wear it.”

She pauses to take a sip of her drink but isn’t done yet.  “I will be watching you closely and correcting you if the need arises.  I don’t intend to be harsh, but I will strive to be strict with you.”

Torei has a long history of girls like you.  It would make more sense, financially, to put you to work—but having a concubine is a prestige thing.  So you will be attending me to social events… like this Club, and I’ve prepared a set of restraints for you to wear to bed—ah!  But I’m getting ahead of myself, aren’t I!”

Months later, the crack of the whip pulls your eyes open suddenly.  The command is made apparent, even if it goes unspoken.  To your left and behind the sound of chains and straining straps announce your team rousing, and you join with them.  From your kneeling position of rest you return to your feet, a difficult maneuver given your bondage but you’re well practiced by now.

Your uniform is red and black laminate, the harness locked across your body the former, boots and armbinder the latter.  A garter belt at your waist nevertheless exposes your womanhood, ponies were kept in such a manner as per regulations, but it does at least hook to the stockings that emerge from your boots.  *Those* are your most undoubtedly Torean feature, the knee high pieces of equipment adding a full foot to your height.  Steel hooves nailed to the bottom of each ensured your footing, but it was the recurved blade that ran from them up to where your foot actually began that gave you the lengthy, loping gallop required of a ponyslave.  Such boots defined you in fact, the Ministry of Improvements having not only adapted you to wearing them, but having done so in a way that made standing flat-footed difficult.  Pure endurance training had provided the rest.

Yet such thoughts are far from your mind as you wait in trembling anticipation, beneath the appalling heat of rural Aekora.  Amongst the lichen fields near the Badlands there was little shade, and your assigned handlers generally kept you from it as a matter of principle.  Your skin is well tanned as a result, amply on display to allow your sweat to run freely.  

[[You bite down on your bit nervously.-&gt;Pony4]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2140" name="Pony4" tags="" position="3737,39576" size="100,100">As always, your bit gives you comfort.  Laminate-padded steel, it is secured firmly between your teeth by the head harness you wear.  Decorative feathers arise from your temples, red colored to match your uniform, while blinders to each side conspire with the posture collar at your throat to ensure you cannot look anywhere but forward.  It kept you, *forced you*, to focus only on marching once the command came.

It does not come yet, however.  Voices behind you talk casually, your handlers for the day discussing their plans.  You merely try to ignore the bit of sweat that runs down your brow, a welcome gust of wind proving so very cool as it tousles your hair.  Like the others the sides of your head have been shaved, leaving a mane that ended in a ponytail and red bow at your mid-back.  

A bit further down, on your left buttock, was your brand.  The Ministry of Truants’ symbol, the same all in their stable shared, encircling your new name.  Or more precisely, number.  5-6, for Precinct 5, Ponyslave 6.  The same marker is on your garter belt, above your cunt, and stamped on the exterior of each of your blinders.

That would be your team Lead being whipped, the heavy laminate expertly slipped up between her legs to snap smartly just above her cunt.  The command to march!

Behind you the team’s Wheelers, the stronger of your quartet begin to step forward as you and your Lead do as well.  Leaning into your harness, you trust it to keep you upright as you dig your hooves into the ground for traction.  Getting started was always the hardest after all, but with one lurching step comes another, then another, each growing easier.

It is far from the most efficient means of marching, but form mattered as much as function on Torei, and you would have undoubtedly been whipped had you done differently.

Your boots extend your every step, amplifying the power of your stride, but the cart behind remains heavy—even for your team of four.  As Second your job is to merely pay attention to the First at your left, while passing commands to the Wheeler behind you.  All of this could be, and was utterly expected to occur without a spoken word.  Your bit prevented speech of course, but even your handlers need not speak.  Their whip could do the talking.

And talk it does.  The road you march along is paved, but roughly, and occasionally the driver behind notices an upcoming pothole as readily as you do.  Steering takes the form of another lash of the Whip to your Lead.  One upon her left flank meant to turn right, while the opposite was expected if it landed upon the left.  Just how *far* she was to turn was wholly her responsibility.

You’re a beast of burden now, denied even speech.  Your handlers only rarely interacted with you directly when on patrol.

“How long do you figure, Sir?”  Comes a voice from behind, one of the two female officers to which you had been assigned today.  Her superior, a male, clearly takes a moment to consider.

“Well, we’re about 64 miles out from the station.  5-3,” your Lead, “and her team always set a good pace.  Do the math… and we’re looking at a good eight, maybe nine hour run.  That’s if we push them, perhaps only give them a singular watering break.  Even so, they will be well lathered by the end.”

Another unspoken command, this one indicating the begin of your long march back towards the station you now called home: an indicator of expected pace.  One crack would have meant walk, three a canter, four a gallop.  Two meant a trot, a comfortable enough pace for the time being.

As you and the rest of your pony team settle in, you try to get into a pleasant rhythm.  Back straight, knees rising to complete each high step, enhanced boots springing you forward and pulling the cart behind.  You have a *long* way to go, and you know from hard-earned experience it will be a lengthy, often monotonous march.  But the posture collar positioned tightly around your neck reminds you readily that you no longer have a choice when it came to such things.  As a ponygirl, you will march until your legs burn, until you all but beg to stop, until your Master finally calls you to a halt.  Stopping any time before would earn only the whip.

The occasional moisture collector stands out amongst the brownish-red lichen, but otherwise you have little of interest to gaze upon.

Officer Karsis could have instructed them to see about handling your team, but as he often did he instead appears to be doing it himself.  As always he begins with your Lead, his shadow visible from your blindered position but little else as he kneels down.  Presumably 5-3&#39;s gag is removed, you hear water dribbling onto the ground followed by quiet speech.  How was she doing?  How was the pace?  Questions reserved for the Lead alone.  

Your turn follows soon after, the laminate-uniformed man kneeling before you with an apologetic smile.  One hand holds a large water bottle while the other slides beneath your chin, merely lifting it to meet your gaze.  The shadow of a beard cannot hide the kindness in his eyes.

&quot;Holding up, 5-6?&quot;

There was no point in arguing, or resisting.  Your bondage is total, and your superior&#39;s will absolute.  Trying to be anything more than a pony earned you only pain and discomfort.  Better to submit, to be obedient.  You&#39;re a slave, and a good one at that.

Master Karsis certainly thinks so, as he appears suddenly in your view of view.  &quot;A harsh pace, I know, but you are doing well, team.&quot;  Casually he pushes a finger into your mouth, his laminate glove lifting your lips.  Already spread because of the bit lodged between them, he clearly wasn&#39;t seeking to enter your mouth.  &quot;A little lathered, I see.  Hm.&quot;

He moves to your side, addressing your Lead.  &quot;5-3, back on your feet.  All of you.  We still have another four hours or so to go.&quot;

His command is met with several gagged moans, your own joining in, but as a team you do rise.  The pony boots you wear, besides lengthening your stride and multiplying your pulling strength also serve to make you quite a bit taller-- you&#39;re a full head above the Master once you&#39;re back up on aching legs.  He hardly seems to notice, besides the need to reach up, pulling one of your straps just a bit tighter.  Your bit is forced even harder into the back of your mouth.

&quot;Load up,&quot; he directs the two women accompanying him.  Soon after comes the crack of the whip, as expected.

There was no point in arguing, or resisting.  Your bondage is total, and your superior&#39;s will absolute.  Trying to be anything more than a pony earned you only pain and discomfort.

It would be completely in Master Petros’ right to punish you, or us both, if he so desired.”

It is with that she steps forward, guiding you by the leash most of the way before release just as you approach Petros together.  The chain runs down between your breasts, clinking against the triangular pendent that hangs from your neck.  Euphoria’s intentions are clear as she uses her now freed hands to pull back the laminate of her cloak, revealing her hips fully as she spreads her legs.  The reverence she performs is immaculate, and quite deep, pushing the limits of her corsetry as she bends over so very completely.

Lacking your Superior’s cloak you instead flare out your gloved hands, while ensuring your legs are properly spread.  By the time you have matched her position your habit hangs down to either side of your head.  

A moment passes, then two, in silence.  Your veil prevents you from seeing anything but the booted feet of the Master before you, as well as Euphoria’s heeled counterparts.  Neither move.  Eventually a full minute passes, and concern wells in your throat.  Were you supposed to do something more?

As I do, reverence—now!”

Petros has clearly noticed you, but watches silently, arms still crossed as he had been upon approach.  Even through his mask, obscuring all features, you can nevertheless almost *feel* his domineering gaze upon you.  Unspoken disapproval pours forth.

She remains as before however, head bowed fully parallel with the ground, cloak flared in reverence.  Even her habit is unmoving, obscuring her masked face.  

Yet movement does come from before you, as Master Petros’ feet final shift, the man evidently moving from his leaning position upon the pole.

“Sister Euphoria,” he greets, an accent twisting each word ever so slightly.  “A pleasure, as always.  You may rise, as may your Sister.  I would have an introduction.  She is the new one you spoke of?  The impatience of youth, I see.”  You sense displeasure in that last portion.

For a moment he remains as before, heavy boots crossed in the manner he leans against the pole.  Your own shoes, stilettoed and sleek, could hardly be more different.  Yet movement does come eventually,  Master Petros’ feet finally shifting as he abandons the prior pose for a standing one.

“Sister Euphoria,” he greets, an accent twisting each word ever so slightly.  “A pleasure, as always.  You may rise, as may your Sister.  I would have an introduction.  She is the new one you spoke of?  The impatience of youth, I see.”  You sense displeasure in that last portion.

“Sister Euphoria,” he greets, an accent twisting each word ever so slightly.  “A pleasure, as always.  You may rise, as may your Sister.  I would have an introduction.  She is the new one you spoke of?  Few sluts are as patient as this one.”

She *is* very new to her collar, and still learning the ways of our Order-- and much the same can be said of humility and submission as well.&quot;

Turning to you, the much taller nun&#39;s disappointment is broadcast readily from the only exposed bit of her body-- the eyes, as deep red as ever.  Even so, she directs her words solely at Petros.  &quot;If it would please you, Master, we are of course ready for whatever correction you deem necessary.&quot;

Master Petros exhales sharply, the sound rasped through his mask.  &quot;I will allow her my indulgence, this *once.*&quot;

[[You sense that is as much mercy as Petros ever gave.-&gt;Nun6]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2168" name="NunPet5Rev" tags="" position="2090,16208" size="100,100">The subtle sound of Euphoria&#39;s habit and robes shifting across her catsuit beneath announces her rise, but you remain where you are-- at least until your fellow Sister places a hand at the small of your back.  &quot;Rise,&quot; she commands, another gloved hand upon your shoulder moving you along.  &quot;Submission is our way, but overindulgence is a Sin unto itself.&quot;

Finally pulling yourself back into a standing position, you note in Euphoria&#39;s eyes a hint of approval-- if not without the need for further guidance.  You had done well enough, but the path you had taken to walk alongside her would remain treacherous indeed.

[[Petros remains impossible to read, beneath his mask.-&gt;Nun6]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2169" name="NunPet5" tags="" position="2240,16208" size="100,100">You and Euphoria both rise from reverence in unison, the approving look she directs your way indicates her intent moments before she addresses such directly.  &quot;My Sister is young, and inexperienced, but she has much promise, Master.&quot;

Turning to you, the much taller nun&#39;s motherly goodwill is broadcast readily from the only exposed bit of her body-- the eyes, as deep red as ever.

Expectations meet reality head on, as little results from the effort.  As odorless as it was bland, slave feed provided nutrition and not much else.  Torei was too resource poor to waste much effort on something a large portion of the population subsisted upon.

“Come now, Cici,” (if: $CorSlave is true)[Corinth](else:)[your Mistress’ Soubrette] says from above.  “Don’t be picky, eat like the good kitten you are.”

Your Mistress and the man pause, both looking your way—only to then turn to each other, laughing a bit.

“I think my Cici has taken a liking to you,” Alexandra muses, a laminate gloved finger held to her chin.

“I met her briefly upon arrival,” the man replies.  “And she is well trained, truly.  Which means I suspect she likes anyone willing to play with her pussy.”

That earns a second round of laughter from the pair, who then continue on their way.  You’re left behind, bound and gagged, little more than a plaything to the pair.

Glancing back you see the soubrette holding one of your controllers, the devices that gave others such control over you freely available around the house.

(if: $CorSlave is true)[“Oh, I do hate using that on you Cici, but it is for your own good.

Just before your collar shocks you, *hard.*  You bite down on your hidden ring gag, back arching in reflex as the pain courses through you.  The experience is not long, but it is intense indeed.  When it relents you look up, only to find Corinth already standing.

“Sorry, Cici… but you should know I’m Mistress’ girl first, and not yours.  When I tell her you tried to get me to let you cum, I know she will reward me… and punish you.  But you deserve it, don’t you?  You *know* the rules.”

One end is snapped to your cage side, the other your collar.  It hangs down, between your breasts, as she rises and brushes her hands together.

“There.  Now, my secret?  The Mistress had me setup a fucking machine, to be used if you caught your little toy… or if proved particularly naughty, as I understood it.”  (if: $Toy is false)[Her smile turns predatory.  “That means, of course… that you will never get that toy, leashed as you are.

Clean white walls and yellow accent walls are accentuated by modern décor, reflecting Aekora’s position as a mountainous Ringdom as much as Mistress Alexandra’s personal tastes.  

Ascending the stairs that led up into the Mistress’ personal quarters, your fellow slave pauses at a closed door.  “Mistress...?  I have Cici, as requested.”

The bedroom itself is as well appointed as any other section of the Royallis’ household, the stylings modern and sleek.  Like any good Torean-born household, the bed itself is the focal point, large in size and featuring numerous steel fasteners along its heavy frame and canopy.  Those could be used for all manner of restraints, including full suspension, but for now they sit empty.  

The base of the bed concerns you more however, as you look upon your secondary cage—similar in most functions to the one you woke up in, but this one was retained for special uses.  Usually rewards... or punishments, as the device occupying most of it now suggests.  (if: $SubBetray is true)[As the soubrette had teased,](else:)[Rewards had been promised, but even you’re surprised by] the heavy pneumatic device slotted into the rear of the cage, mechanical and imposing.  A central piston mounts a laminate phallus, large and extensively ribbed and it glistens, apparently already lubed for use.

The mere sight of it makes your knees weak, especially once you notice the restraints added to the bottom of the cage.  Four cuffs, spaced for wrists and ankles, intended to pin down the slave in the perfect position to allow the pneumatic cock to work at its intended purpose.

The effect is nearly immediate.  Torean slave feed may have been uniform, consistent, but it was common practice to introduce additives catered to each slave.  To yours a strong pheromone was added, one that induced intense and inescapable ecstasy.  But it was dormant, merely lurking in your bloodstream until activated… by that small spray bottle.

You moan immediately, wriggling in your restraints as your legs try to close, to come together.  But you cannot move, cannot reach your suddenly burning cunt, cannot shove the cock any further into your slickened hole.  Any sense of dignity that remained to you, anything that resemble rational thought or effort leaves you.  In that short moment you’re reduced to an animal in intense heat, your own cunt the very center of your universe.

She stands, and behind you the machine engages.  The cock buried within you pulls out, inch by enraptured inch.  Your horomone-addled body can hardly track it, synapses burn the feeling into one elongated experience—that ends with a **bang** as the cock is suddenly drilled into you.

You would have cummed there, immediately and with force, but your collar and rainbow array intervene.  The first shocks you sharply, the latter temporarily numbing your sensual nerves.  Instead of rocketing off the cliff of climax you’re left, damningly, teetering on the edge before sliding back down.  A moan slips your lips, utterly unbidden, as your very womb aches for that orgasm you had been denied.  

Yet you’ve hardly come to terms with the betrayal of your own body before it happens again, the cock shifting, your cunt dripping with ecstatic agony—only to be denied again.  And again, and again…

“Remember,” Alexandra says, somewhere atop her bed.  She must be securing her other slave.  “Remember that I love you, Cici.”

You cum there, *hard*.  An orgasmic moan slips your gags as your abdomen aches, the muscles of your womanhood suckling on the cock within you as the ecstasy blasts through you, wave after wave.  You had reached climax, then rocketed off it—the phallus having paused fully hilted inside as you quiver in glorious rapture.  Yet as soon as the afterglow hits, finding you panting in your bondage, the cock begins again.  You don’t think it possible, but the pheromones and your Torean libedo rise immediately to the challenge.  How many times will you cum tonight?  Forty times?  A hundred?

The machine shifts, driving deeper into your mouth until your lips are pressed against the laminate phallus’ base.  Your gag reflex had been overwritten by the Ministry of Improvements.  As it withdraws, Alexandra claps her hands together.  “Excellent!  But… I do have a bit more motivation.”

Corinth leans back into the plush material of the booth, glancing out at Club Lush before returning her attention to you alone.  “You probably know better than I that Torei sort of functions on… arousal, right?

“Well, right.  Let us… just go over the basics, at least?  Jog that memory.  You’ve always been full of questions, after all.  They could not have trained that out of you at the Academy.”

Of a lesser grade, to keep things more rational.  But still.  A Mistress has expectations as well.”

Her teeth gleam as she bares them, the smile turning predatory.  “And of course it helps justify keeping a concubine slave, doesn’t it?  Especially one with all the different improvements I made to her.”

Looking down, you have to at least cede that point.  The swell of your chest and hips is more pronounced now, but still natural looking.  For what amounted to surgery on most worlds, there is no evidence of it having occurred mere hours earlier.

“I know it will take some time for you to get used to,” she continues, as your eyes meet again.  “But… you look great, babe.  I know that dress was literally made for you, given how Wardrobes work, but I still mean it when I say you rock it!”

But I do have another reason.  Did you know red hair isn’t naturally Torean?  Something about their genetics.  Traditionalists don’t care for it, I’ve been told.  Which is also why I chose it.  I’m *not* Torean, neither are you.  Why not flaunt it?”

Two of the fingers on her hand point towards you, then move in a tight circle.  “And, you know, if I’m going to own a slave I should at least get to pick her hair color!  Just like I picked the dress.”

[[“You adjusted my measurements.”-&gt;ExamFill]]

Corinth takes in the sight as your hands come together upon the table between you, the opera length gloves matching everything else in shade.  Unlike the strangers that surrounded you however, only she could know about the extensive lingerie beneath.

“What do you mean?”  Your Mistress asks.

[[“I just wanted to say that I love it, Corinth!”-&gt;DressLove]]

Both of you are gloved, you in red her in black, the colors intermingling.  “I had some of my old clothing, offworld textiles and the like, shipped here while you were at the Academy.  Just incase I needed them.  But you… you will be wearing laminate, only, going forward.  Dresses and bras, corsets and garters… they trained you on heels too, at the Academy?  Right?”

[[“Extensively.-&gt;DressLove2]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2230" name="DressExpect" tags="" position="5759,41334" size="100,100">“Why is that?  Torei has all sorts of slaves, and all sorts of owners.  And there is nothing odd about a favored concubine being taken out on the town, in a glossy dress!  You should count yourself lucky some lichen farmer didn’t buy you, put you in a full enclosure suit all day working their fields.  Although now that I say it, you would probably like that I’m thinking… ah, nevermind.  What I mean to say is that I’ll keep you however I like, and I *like* you in this way right now.”

She pauses to take a sip from her glass, but smiles over the rim before actually drinking.  “And its not the only thing you’re wearing, is it?”

[[“It is not, Mistress!”-&gt;DressExpect2]]
[[“You mean… the undergarments?”-&gt;DressExpect2]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2231" name="DressLove2" tags="" position="5609,41484" size="100,100">“*Wonderful,*” Corinth gleefully smiles.  “The expectation that a woman, much less a slave, need almost always be heeled was probably the hardest bit for me to adapt to.  My poor toes, those first few weeks and months.  But you know what I’m talking about, and I hope you’d agree that the way it improves one’s posture and the overall look… well, I’ve come to find out it is hard to go wrong with stilettos!”

That the Wardrobe had managed such intricacy without breaking the smooth lines of the dress atop them is a testament to Torean engineering.  Likewise, the fact that it had been a recommended addition for “submissive personalities” spoke to just how well Torei knew those who would be wearing such.

“We will get to that,” Corinth promises.

Enough nutrition in a single meal to keep you going for the day, and that’s important.  I intend to make sure you keep to a good diet, and good exercise.  I want you as healthy as you can be.”

Much like porridge or oatmeal it is liquid, but viscous.  Never having looked appetizing, the way your spook slowly slides into the gruel hardly furthers the prospect.

It certainly doesn’t taste *good*.  Or like much of anything at all.  The lack of flavor is matched to a strange textureless sensation, as if the Feed itself was as glossy and smooth as any piece of laminate clothing.  You’re almost surprised how easily it goes down… and how readily the idea of biting into a proper meal suddenly resonates with you in that moment.

She stands, sliding from the booth as she offers her hand.  Her other extends towards the rest of Club Lush, the scene below the VIP balcony as always a riotous affair of laminate.

“Can you dance?”  She asks, only to run over your actual answer.  “Although I guess the better question would be if you remember, right?  Don’t worry about it, babe.  Come on, I’ll show you.  Now that we’ve hashed everything out there is so much I’m ready to show you.”

You met Cherish months ago, and while this one isn’t her the outfit is the same—as is the Club’s means of compelling them to do good work.  When Corinth presses another button the slave is treated to a bit of vibration from her piercing, her thighs coming reflexively together.

Afterward she thanks Corinth profusely, withdrawing with her tray.  It is a small taste of everyday Torean life, and far more enjoyable than the mouthful of slave feed you have in that moment.

&quot;You really need to pay more attention,&quot; Tess replies, with amusement.  &quot;Its been a few months, and you *still* daydream?&quot;

You blink in response, remembering exactly where you are: the Diarch&#39;s Choice.  The entryway and front desk are exactly as you recall from your first visit, now so long ago.  Clean white styling is offset by bits of violet design and decor, while the light streaming in from the front door paints a bright square upon the hardened laminate floor.  In fact you stood right here, where you are now, after waking up with a memory shot through with holes and a deal to make.  

Glancing down, you see how things have changed.  You&#39;re uniformed now of course, wearing the same livery as Tess-- a semi-transparent laminate dress, violet with black shoulders upon which small letters are printed: *Property of Diarch&#39;s Choice Hotel.*  Your collar reinforced that fact, a heavy steel band pulled tight around your throat.  Further down your dress hugs your thighs and hips sharply, a pencil skirt forming.  From that emerges your stockings, black, their connection via garters to the belt beneath your dress nevertheless revealed by the transparency of the latter.  Half-gloves and a set of stiletto heels complete the ensemble.

Its quite the compelling uniform, but in truth you are well acquainted with it by now.

Your Master owned four slaves to maintain Diarch&#39;s Choice, two each for the day and night shifts.

&quot;Alright,&quot; your fellow slave sighs.  &quot;Let me start again, just to be safe.  We were discussing our duties, for the day?  I will be manning the Front Desk, of course.&quot;  As the more experienced slave, that expected.  You were always given the more menial work, which Tess addresses next.

&quot;You will be on call, as always, but we do have two rooms that need cleaning.  Room 3 was checked out completely, you just need to prep that one for someone else to rent it.  Room 6 also needs cleaning, but Master Alphono rented it for the week.  He left a note he will be out today, so you need only to spruce it up.&quot;

[[&quot;Will our Master be around today?&quot;-&gt;HotelMaster]]
[[&quot;Rooms 3 and 6, got it.&quot;-&gt;Hotel5]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2245" name="HotelMaster" tags="" position="6450,42209" size="100,100">&quot;No,&quot; Tess replies, reaching up to adjust her collar a bit.  &quot;Or at least, he did not warn me he would.  You know how he is, only stopping in occasionally-- he trusts us.  But I&#39;m sure if we keep up our good work he will reward us next time he stops in!&quot;

She&#39;s enthusiastic about the prospect.  &quot;So we need to keep up on our daily tasks, keep the Hotel running!  And that means...&quot;

[[&quot;Rooms 3 and 6 need cleaning, got it.-&gt;Hotel5]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2246" name="Hotel5" tags="" position="6600,42209" size="100,100">&quot;Good girl,&quot; Tess purrs, then laughs.  &quot;Now get going, those rooms aren&#39;t going to clean themselves!&quot;

As you step back from the counter Tess settles into her seat, sitting primly.  Back straight, chest pressed invitingly forward, its the same sort of posture you&#39;ve been trained to keep.  A proper Torean Hotel made sure its slaves were as desirable as its rooms, after all.  

Brushing a bit of your hair from your eyes, blonde to match Tess and your Master&#39;s other slaves, you look about the lobby.  Columns at all four corners rise to meet a recessed ceiling above, while below the marble floor is marked with the light from outside.  Its still early morning, before most of the day&#39;s new arrivals would be coming for rooms.  

Besides the door to the world outside there is only one other, the glass panel and portal that led to the Hotel&#39;s rooms and amenities.  Pursing your violet-painted lips, you turn that way, heels snapping sharply against the floor as you set off.

The only question is where you start:

[[Start with Room 3-&gt;Room3]]

As always, one of the Academy&#39;s Wardrobe Devices had dressed you for shipment.  Violet laminate is the base of it, running from neck to toes and designed intentionally to be semi-transparent.  Your accessories, corset, collar, and boots are darker to provide a pleasing contrast, the black nevertheless gleaming as you&#39;re lowered into your waiting box.  An armbinder circles your shoulders and holds your arms behind you, rendering you properly helpless, but it is the shipping box&#39;s padding that truly immobilizes you.  Printed in further laminate to match your exact measurements, it embraces your legs and hips, your waist and shoulders, and even has a larger indention for your bound arms.  A ballgag completes your ensemble, while your blonde hair is carefully arranged around your head.

Several shipping straps follow, at ankles, knees, waist, and throat.  Beside you several accessories are provided, the particulars differing based upon the buyer&#39;s preference.  In your case they prove to be a vibrating wand, a blindfold, and most importantly a Wardrobe data chit preloaded with hundreds of other coordinated Doll outfits-- all of which slot neatly into compartments printed into the padding for just their use.

[[The last piece is your box&#39;s lid.-&gt;DollEnd4]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2250" name="DollEnd4" tags="" position="2931,39589" size="100,100">&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/GJatby9.png&quot; width=&quot;30%&quot; height=&quot;30%&quot;&gt;

Sliding the lid into place, Headmistress Vallis herself flicks the mag-locks closed one by one.  You&#39;re a captive audience to it all as you peer out from the plastic viewport within the lid, intended not for your own use but to display you for both the curious and of course your new owner.  A violet ribbon, matching your catsuit, is tied into a neat bow as the finishing touch.

&quot;There we are,&quot; the Headmistress concludes, looking over her handiwork once more before brushing gloved hands together.  Only then does she lean in, her crimson lips pulled into a sharp smile.  &quot;Comfortable, Doll?  I hope so.  You&#39;ve been purchased by...&quot; her eyes flick to the shipping labeled hooked to the side of your box.  &quot;...Master Tenyon, of Arendesh Ringdom.  Do you know where that is?  Almost certainly not.  Well, its not quite Antipodal, but it is quite far from the Way Up, or Aekora.  It used to take a good two months, but with the new high speed line you will reach there by train, in about... three weeks.&quot;

She taps her fingers against the viewport of your box.  &quot;The supplements we gave you are slow-burning, you won&#39;t be hungry during the trip at least.  And your body will produce no waste to concern you.  But I know how our Dolls are, you&#39;re not worried about that.  No, you&#39;re just thinking with your cunt... and yes, we planned for that too.&quot;

She pulls forth a glass device, tapping a few quick keys.  Your body, or more accurately the piercings at your clit and nipples installed by the Ministry of Improvements during your training answer readily.  A slight tingle is followed by the direct stimulation of your most sensitive of sensual hotspots, and almost immediately you wriggle happily in your bondage.

&quot;I see you&#39;re feeling it,&quot; the Headmistress notes, sounding warm-- a rare tone from the strict authoritarian.  The hand that had been tapping your box now caresses it slowly as she meets your eyes one last time.  &quot;Goodbye, Doll.  Remember you represent Celeste Academy at its best.  Serve Master Tenyon well... and enjoy your new life.  The porters will be here in the morning to collect you.&quot;

And with that she leaves, flicking off the light to the room as she goes.  You&#39;re left in darkness, with only your body&#39;s eager sensations to occupy you.  The tight pull of laminate, the strict corset at your waist, the unyielding bondage-- and of course the tickling purr of your stim array, all of it to be maintained throughout your three week trip to your new home.

[[You moan into your gag, happily lost in laminate.-&gt;DollEnd5]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2251" name="DollEnd5" tags="" position="2930,39739" size="100,100">In the morning a pair of men in laminate overhauls come for you.  They look the part of manual labor and soon act like it, working together to heft your box between them.  You vaguely recognize the logo on their gear as being a premier transport company of some sort, which explained how they could employ men on Torei for such work-- it would be as much a matter of prestige and meeting expectations as it is the simple fact that men are so often stronger.

You can do little beyond rest in your box as they carry you of course, looking up through the lid at the sky above.  In the early light of dawn you still catch glimpses of Grand Aekora&#39;s twinkling skyline in the distance, and beyond that the Way Up itself-- a string of pearls stretching towards infinity.

You&#39;ve come so far from that troubled woman who had rode down the elevator over a year ago.  The physical aspects are obvious, of course.  At your new Master&#39;s direction you have been improved, made bustier and with more dramatic hips, as well as a host of other alternations.  But the true change is in your thinking, the way you perceive yourself as much as Torei around you.  You&#39;re happy to serve, to be little more than a sexual toy for others, a *Doll* in more than just name.  Struggling allows you to remember little of what life was like before, wearing textiles and working as a prospector-- but simply laying back and obeying your betters brings all manner of delights.  The tight embrace of your laminate and gear is a constant reminder of that, as is the teasing purr of your stim array.

[[You moan quietly.-&gt;DollEnd6]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2252" name="DaeEx" tags="" position="17149,21160" size="100,100">&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/FQWhjCH.png&quot; width=&quot;30%&quot; height=&quot;30%&quot;&gt;

*Where are you?*

**Who** *are you?*

You remember, but only barely.  Its so hard now, and you have so little reason to.  Such things get in the way of the sensations, the all encompassing, all consuming ways in which your Isolation Laminate made you feel.  And it is yours now, more than it had ever been.  Somewhere a chronometer ticks over, noting the passage of time, but you merely are aware-- somewhat-- that it has been months since you first entered that mask, this suit.  You need not remove it, you *cannot*.  

**Would you even still want to?**

You feel a twinge of discomfort at that thought.  A scent is pushed into your mask, something tangy, metallic.  Three blue triangles form on your mask&#39;s inner HUD.  Consciously you cannot comprehend what any of it meant, you&#39;ve long given up trying, yet somehow you&#39;ve learned to understand.  (colour: purple)[To obey.]

So you begin walking again, a figure of gleaming black surrounded by total darkness.  Your heels snap against the smooth rock beneath, echoing into eternity.  A tunnel.  Torei&#39;s terraforming continued, shepherded by the same AIs that owned you now, and this had once been a means to their far future end.  You pass by another Daemon, female, legs spread and back arched upon the ground as it experiences an ecstasy only your kind can understand.

There are four of you, beneath the blistering sun.  Each of you have three holes, three inserts.  All are in use.  Together you squirm entwined, legs and arms together, breasts to rear to waist, mask to mask.  Your laminate gleams as it glides effortlessly against your fellow Daemons, a thigh between your legs allowing you to press your hips forward, humping slowly, instructed to draw out the sensations.  A moan escapes you but is lost to your mask, to the cock inserted down your throat.  You no longer have a gag reflex, a quirk only offworlders had to be cured of anyway.  

Are you being rewarded?  You think so.  Of the others you have not an inkling, and little reason to care.  You were directed here, to converge, in the depths of the Badlands.  There are no buildings, no people, only unfinished work.  Vaguely beyond your mask, before another Daemon presses her cunt to it, you can see the rock formations surrounding you.  Rain rarely visited here, and only desperate humans sought refuge in such a wasteland.

But you are not human, not while in your Isolation Laminate.  Humans thought and fought, spoke and argued, made decisions.  (colour: purple)[You only obey.]

The ziggurat that rises before you gleams as readily beneath the stars as any laminate, a subtle warmth melting the snow to reveal where earth became... something else.  You no longer have the faculties to investigate, but you sense it is not metal, nor one of the myriad forms of laminate.  The AI are something else entirely, massive as they are ancient.  

You have not been brought here to speak with them, of course.  They do not talk, they do not even think as you do-- although your conditioning is pushing you in that direction, allowing you to grasp at strands in a tapestry of design and intent you are utterly incapable of truly fathoming.

Panicked, you try to sit up but cannot.  You may not be bound, but a clear barrier is just a few inches above you.  Glass, you recognize.  You&#39;re in a glass tube.  Barely larger than your prone self, rounded like a vial.  The only break in the smooth glass is a more metallic panel just below your head, to which a chain is attached within the vial itself.  Your eyes follow it down to find it linked to your throat, to the thin band of metal that encircles it.  A collar.  *Your* collar.  In the slight reflection of the glass you can see it is bare metal, except for a set of symbols set into the bottom edge.  They glow, a sickly sort of yellow.

Your reflection also reveals the source of a sensation you had only begun to notice-- you&#39;re in... water?  Some sort of liquid, pitch black but thin, running like water.  It fills the bottom half of the vial, covering your shoulders but not rising to cover your head or breasts.

Perhaps half of the vials are occupied, all of them with women (and the occasional man) in a state of nudity much like your own.

The nearest vial holds another woman, her short cut hair a bright red.  Somewhere in the spiraling mass that is your own confusion, you recognize that as strange.  Why?

Something *does* change, however.

Images project along the curved surface of the vial, flicking so quickly you can barely perceive what you&#39;re shown.  An inverted triangle, white on a field of black.  A forest, unlike anything you&#39;ve ever seen on Torei.  Then black, black, more black, now broken by waves of light.  Smooth, glossy, you recognize it even as the camera pans out: laminate.  A daemon, writhing in glorious euphoria.  Then walking, now on its knees, hips thrusting silently.  

The strange images keep coming, and you settle back into the black liquid of your vial, strangely calmed.

Yet the sound that emerges is strangely deadened, as if your vial consumes most of it, allowing only a faint echo to linger afterward.  For a moment you think it almost a wasted effort, the tortured confusion that came before rational thought took over-- until a response, of sorts, comes.

Images project along the curved surface of the vial, flicking so quickly you can barely perceive what you&#39;re shown.  An inverted triangle, white on a field of black.  A forest, unlike anything you&#39;ve ever seen on Torei.  Then black, black, more black, now broken by waves of light.  Smooth, glossy, you recognize it even as the camera pans out: laminate.  A daemon, writhing in glorious euphoria.  Then walking, now on its knees, hips thrusting silently.  

The strange images keep coming, and you settle back into the black liquid of your vial, strangely calmed.

The chain running from your collar to the panel of metal set into the glass jingles quietly as your strange enclosure shifts, sloshing the black liquid, then turns vertical.  That black liquid runs down, filling the vial to your knees as the entire apparatus moves.  Outwardly first, then down, towards the floor.  Just what it intended is made suddenly clear when the glass upon which you are now standing unceremoniously gives way, shifting to the side upon a seam you had not seen.

You drop the foot or so left to the ground, unsteady legs giving way as you end up upon your knees.  Black liquid pours down around you, splashing momentarily but draining quickly *through* the floor.  Small holes, pores almost, pepper the otherwise white floor material.  It has a bit of give as well, unlike anything you&#39;ve ever experienced before.  The strange floor is almost put to use again as a wave of queasiness runs through you, but you swallow hard, holding it down.

Looking up, you find yourself on a small platform.  Much like the rest of the room, the floor curves and bends in an irregular manner, but the platform upon which you kneel is flat.  Before you can observe further however, a glinting hint of light draws your eyes upward.  There you find the metal portion of the vial slid out upon your release, following a slot along the floor.  Your leash, and thus collar, remain chained to it-- and with only moments to spare you move forward before it would have tugged you.The chain is too short for you to stand, so that you must crawl.

To your surprise you find yourself wet and aching, as if starved for attention.  You move to address that need immediately, pressing your fingers to your lower lips, but it takes only moments for frustration to begin to build.

This... is a pale imitation of what you *need.*  Even shifting your efforts, leaning more heavily upon direct stimulation of your clit produces little of the ecstasy you *knew* was possible... from your time in the Isolation Laminate.  How could you ever compare with such an experience?  That&#39;s a question that lands particularly hard, despite the jumble of other questions floating inside your mind.  

You&#39;ve supped from a nectar too sweet for any human hand, any ministration of your own, to equal.

It clearly was not designed for human use.  The ceiling bends and undulates, the walls shift at incomprehensible angles for unknowable reasons.  At a fork one side becomes dramatically smaller, impassable.  Twice you pass under vents discharging some manner of violet gas, whatever it was terribly cold, you&#39;re glad you are not stopped beneath it.  The only consistency comes in the color, a uniform black from which everything is built.  

And through it all you crawl, naked and head shaved, pulled along by the chain running to the slot in the floor.  You have no doubt you would be forcibly pulled if you attempted to stop.

[[Another fork approaches.-&gt;InsideAI2]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2263" name="InsideAI2" tags="" position="16499,22212" size="100,100">&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/nC8CvwZ.jpg&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; height=&quot;50%&quot;&gt;

Fresh light suddenly intrudes, replacing the dingy gloom that otherwise prevailed.  And you&#39;re not alone.  

The passage widens to reveal a Daemon in full regalia, standing with its hand upon a clear panel.  Without eyes to see it peers out at a scene utterly foreign to Torei-- lush green foliage, trees and running water.  It stretches out for quite awhile, hills rising in the distance.  *Where are you?*  In that moment you think perhaps you have been transported, brought to some strange new world, but looking to the sky reveals it to be a stark white-- almost artificially so.  Some manner of... biodome, perhaps?  Or perhaps the window was merely a screen, a projection producing a synthetic image.

Either way, neither your leash nor the Daemon pay your interest any mind.  The former keeps moving, and the latter remains in place as you continue on.

[[Behind you the bright light grows ever dimmer.-&gt;InsideAI3]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2264" name="InsideAI3" tags="" position="16499,22363" size="100,100">How long have you been crawling?  Long enough for your hands and knees to have grown sore, you realize.  Was the AI truly so large?  How far did it extend underground?  You&#39;ve never really considered the prospect.  Or perhaps you had?  You still cannot recall what happened before that fate day, waking on that hotel bed.  Afterward you had been so concerned with your deal, maybe even leaving... and afterward there had been only your suit.  Submission.  

Before you can consider that line of thought further, however, your leash suddenly pivots sharply left.  A chunk, and that is how best the irregular piece of wall could be described, moves aside for you to pass through.  And then you&#39;re nearly blinded by the stark white light that emerges.  You&#39;re forced to close your eyes even as you crawl into the room, but you feel your lead halting even as you slowly try to blink away the painful brightness.

What you eventually find is a pristine white room, separated in two by a set of bars running from ceiling to floor.  Your side is empty, even the entrance you had used is now gone, but the other side is occupied-- by a Daemon.  Sleek black laminate covers it from head to toe, as always, but this one is reclined in a chair, its arms locked into a straitjacket.  Its legs are spread by padded extensions, while heavy laminate straps scattered about secure it firmly in place.

It writhes in that bondage, muffled moans escaping it.  You stand, finding your leash has disconnected from the floor, and approach the bars.  Something... something is wrong.  Its so hard to think here, after all that has happened, after all you&#39;ve seen and experienced.  But... you... *know* that voice.  Did Daemons even make sounds?  You don&#39;t remember ever hearing them.  But you&#39;ve heard this one before, of course you have... its...

[[You.-&gt;AITrip]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2265" name="AITrip" tags="" position="16499,22513" size="100,100">&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/scf6kDr.png&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; height=&quot;50%&quot;&gt;

It can&#39;t be.  And yet the more you stare at it, listen to it, you become more certain.  That Daemon is *you*, as you have been since you entered that mask... so long ago.  How many hours or even days did you spend, with only your own muffled moans as company?

Bewildered you lean against the bars separating you from... yourself, and find that you can slide your arm between the alabaster metal.  This was no projection.  Further confusion floods your mind, and as if on cue haptic displays suddenly engage.

You step back, startled, to see a pair of shapes projected before you, as if floating above the bars.  Another round of recognition chills you as your realize they&#39;re the same sort a Daemon&#39;s mask projected inside, for reasons unknown.  Yet these you *can* make out, if only by staring at them.  Then the strange lines, the overlapping shapes within the larger more clearly defined shapes collect into... not words, but something you somehow understand.

To your left, in the square: **RELEASE.**
To your right, in the triangle: (colour: purple)[**OBEY.**]

Your choice is answered by an immediate hiss to your side.  Turning, you find another opening has been revealed.  From the bright white room you are greeted by a darkened tunnel, shaped almost like a pipe, running upward.  Towards the surface.  Towards... release?

You look back to the struggling, moaning figure strapped to the chair.  You&#39;ve been through a lot, you must have been mistaken.  How could that be you?  An impossibility.  You need not stay, even if the second haptic button remains.

It all made sense now, didn&#39;t it?  When you first met the Daemon in that hotel room, it had not tried to compel you, but had *offered* you the helmet.  The AIs, Mazos and Dahom... they must valued consent.  Of course!  Why wouldn&#39;t they let you leave?  Why would you ever want to stay?

You pause, thinking back to... that Daemon who had been so like you.  To the pleasure it had been so clearly being subjected to.  Blinded, deafened, made helpless before the very God you still stood within.  You can remember every moment of your previous encapsulation in exquisite detail now, every carefully tuned sensation fed into your strictly bound body, every blissful tweak of your own sensuality.  It had been (colour: purple)[bliss.]  And now that was lost to you.

You pause, a hand landing upon the smooth stone of the tunnel.  Turning back, glancing the way you had come, you can still see the light of that bright room you had just left.  You almost expect to see a Daemon there, beckoning, but only your own thoughts greet you.  You should have better reasons to persist in your escape.  Liberty and freedom and dignity-- but in that moment they seem but shadows compared to that all consuming light.  Even when you close your eyes the sensation lingers, figments dancing upon your eyelids.

Inescapably.  Each staccato inhalation marks your confusion, your fear, yet the sheer panic slides slowly away as you reach up.  Bit by bit.  To that set of symbols you could not read, yet knew what they say:

Release.  You were offered release, you&#39;ve taken, and now you feel that if you do not seize it with both hands you will never have the will to do so again.  Its a powerful fear, shoveling away any rational thought to reveal the primal creature within you.  Fight or flight, the primordial responses.  The latter drives you to an ancient looking door at the top of the tunnel, so different from the strange architecture you&#39;ve witnessed so far.  

You shove the errant thought aside and pull hard on a rusted release mechanism, straining for only a moment before it gives way.  With a yelp the door swings open and you stumble through.  A gust of wind bitter cold greets you, the strange metal of the ziggurat beneath you, the polar sky above. You&#39;re out!  Free!

Celebration must wait as you return to your feet, running nude except for your collar.  Some instinctual urge drives you off the ziggurat as if a whip was being worked upon your flank, pushing you into the freezing snow beyond.  There mere feet from the edge of the metallic construction you collapse, panting, the humid warmth of the AI&#39;s domain draining off you rapidly.  You shiver for the first time, frosted breath emerging as you gasp for air.  You will freeze do death out here without clothing or gear, you recognize, yet you linger on your knees.  Something has caught your eye.  

Is there something beneath the snow?

[[You dig at it, slowly.-&gt;AIRelease4]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2271" name="AIRelease4" tags="" position="16417,23133" size="100,100">Even without the frigid wind that blows across your bare back you hold your breath, hands trembling.  You need not dig far, perhaps half a foot, before your fingernails brush up against something hard.  Fear blossoms in your chest, an iron weight upon your heart, for reasons you cannot explain.  You&#39;re scared, terrified, and yet you widen your excavation, brushing more snow away...

...to reveal ice beneath.  Water, the most valuable of resources here on Torei.  Glancing up, you only now notice how the land nearest the ziggurat is flattened, far more so than the small hills that rise some ways off.  You must be on a frozen reservoir, you realize, a useful way for the AI to keep such a powerful terraforming material where it could not be stolen.  

The rigid anxiety that had gripped you releasing all at once.  You laugh, despite the cold.  What had pushed you to such a precipice of fear in the first place?  

Collecting your hands beneath your breasts, you shiver further, the smile that had emerged across your lips sliding away bit by bit.  By chance you look down to the ice again, then incline your head to the left, removing the hole you had dug from your own shadow.

[[Something looks back at you from the ice.-&gt;AIRelease5]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2272" name="AIRelease5" tags="" position="16417,23282" size="100,100">&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/RFI2Vpi.png&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; height=&quot;50%&quot;&gt;

(colour: purple)[A Daemon.]  Beneath the ice you think for a split second, but no.  Its a reflection.  *Your* reflection.

You try to scream but find yourself unable, your Isolation Laminate kept your mouth closed around a laminate phallus after all.  Even the grunted sound you do manage is lost to the wind, although you no longer feel its polar bite.  Panic has once more flooded your system, but your (colour: purple)[Master] had ensured you cannot hurt yourself.  Trying to reach up, to rip the mask from your face, you find your arms bound.  A glance down reveals a straitjacket holding your arms securely.

You have no means of knowing if your vision returns with lights being engaged, or if your Isolation Laminate merely pierces the dark.  Either way, you are allowed to look once more upon a room and scene you so easily recognize.  The clinically clean walls, the smooth floor, all of it a blinding white.  Even the bars that portion the space into halves are white, only your suit and the chair upon which you are strapped stand in contrast.  

(colour: purple)[You are the Daemon in the chair.]

Your silent Master, Mazos or Dahom you have never been told, as always remains silent.  There is no commentary on what you had seen and experienced.  Had it been a dream?  A hallucination?  How long have have you been within the AI&#39;s hallowed halls, maze-like corridors winding in madness deep into the heart of Torei itself?  You will never know, and in truth, it is no longer your purpose to care.  Squirming against your bondage, the straps and straitjacket, there is only the pleasure your holes are allowed.  Inserts all but eternally purring, keeping you forever on the edge of ecstasy, your concerns begin to drop away one by one. Perhaps you&#39;ve always been here.

Eventually you are moved to a position before a door, barely wider than your shoulders.  Your dim senses note there are dozens, hundreds-- perhaps *thousands* of identical such doors stretching in all directions around you, walls and ceilings, even the floor beneath your feet.  The AI&#39;s architecture conformed to no human expectations.

[[The door opens.-&gt;Dealer]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2274" name="Dealer" tags="" position="16393,23513" size="100,100">To call it a room would be far too grandiose, even a &#39;chamber&#39; suggested more than what waits you: a shallow alcove, the matte laminate padding within shaped into a form you can only expect matches your measurements exactly.  (colour: purple)[Your cell.]  Turning around, you do not hesitate to take the step back and into your allotted place.

Restraints emerge immediately from carefully placed slots, laminate bands sliding around your ankles, waist, wrists, and throat.  Pulling tight, they immobilize you as the door slides back down into place.  Had it not also been built with your measurements in mind it would not have closed, but as it is it almost seems to seal around you completely.  A quiet click is all that announces the door locking shut.

You do not yet know it, but within your cell you will stay for the next three months, four weeks, and a day-- until somewhere in the vast machinery of thought that was the AI you belong to, a singular logic gate flips over.  Zero becomes one, and new instructions are dispensed.

[[You will obey, and be of use.-&gt;Dealer2]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2275" name="Dealer2" tags="" position="16393,23663" size="100,100">&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/c4EU7Do.jpg&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; height=&quot;50%&quot;&gt;

Even here, far from the Way Up and the steady stream of offworlders who came down and spread forth upon Torei, their influence could still be felt.  The Badlands supported little in the way of life, the great bands of land between equator and poles still low in priority for Mazos and Dahom.  But this village subsisted, clinging like a forgotten flowerbud to a rockface that provided shade most of the day.  Its people called it Red Harbor, and therein lay the oddity.  *Harbor* was a wholly foreign word to Torei, a planet without oceans or lakes.  

Undoubtedly one of the founders had brought the word with them during their flight here, along with whatever few implements and tools they had managed to leave with.  For this was a village, a tribe, of runaways-- fleeing the slavery that defined the planet.  A free settlement, if an eternally threatened one.  Mere survival out here could be difficult.  Duststorms capable of ripping a building from its foundations emerged from the pole, raging towards the far off equator.  Thus the rocky shelf that anchored the South of the settlement, providing protection.  That solved one of the major needs, but not the other: *water.*

Toreans were born and bred to subsist on far less water than offworlders, but some here had once come from the elevator, and in any case none could do without.

From it patterns emerge, negotiating with the Chief that kneels behind you in supplication.  She called you (colour: purple)[Emissary], treated you with reverence, but still the message you had been sent to deliver strikes her hard.

&quot;Two others,&quot; she pleads.  &quot;Whichever two you like.&quot;

You sense the refusal you deliever, but she&#39;s insistent.  &quot;Three then.  *Please.*  If the aquifer here stays dry, we will perish.  It must be refilled... but not like this.&quot;

You turn your laminate covered head, looking down upon her without eyes to truly see.  The terms will not be changed.

The Chief sighs, pressing her head to the ground in dismay once more before she rises.  At your side she is shorter, your heels give an advantage in height, but strong.  Determined.  &quot;I submit to the terms.&quot;

You withdraw your hand from the wall as the holographic symbols dissolve, then return your gaze to the window just as the Chief raises her voice to call out.  &quot;Daughter!  Come here, child.&quot;

The AI, and thus you, as (colour: purple)[Emissary.]

She trembles at your touch, almost awestruck by how tender it proves to be.  So many thought your kind to be cruel, and you *could* be.  But not always.

Stepping up behind you pull the daughter closer, until her pale flesh meets the utter black of your Isolation Laminate.  She coos at the sensation of your all but frictionless fingertips running along her bared skin, tracing her shoulders as you slowly work downwards.  At her waist your hands separate, one hand following the curve of her rear while the other slips around her hips, to the meeting of her tights.

&quot;Please, don&#39;t...&quot; her words are bitten off by an equally pinched moan as you enter her, your fingers working with precision and deft skill.  Gently you guide her towards her Mother&#39;s bed, and is there you keep her, utilizing the hardpoints built into the furniture upon her.  She is without improvement, and could never take the sort of sensations you have been trained to endure, but you do give her a taste.  A tantalizing, yet ever so fleeting demonstration of what your kind could do.

She climaxes again and again, sometimes pleading for you to stop, other times begging for more.  Eventually its exhaustion that ends her time with you, and its with the coming dawn that you finally rise from her side.  You leave her there, asleep and chained spread-eagle upon the bed, but not before stopping at the roughly hewn table nearby.  There you produce a rectangle of pure black, glossy as your suit, upon which words are embossed.  A Black Card.  An invitation.  An adventure, for it would require the daughter to travel far.  North, across the Badlands, through the lichen farms, into the Ringdoms proper.  To one called Aekora, to a hotel by the name of *Diarch&#39;s Choice...*

[[Either way, you climax in unison with the other Daemon.-&gt;DaeEx3C]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2281" name="DaeEx3C" tags="" position="17307,21476" size="100,100">Hours later, you stand within a maelstrom, laminate fingers working closed a heavy lock.  A dust storm had rolled in from the South, a common enough occurrence in the Badlands.  Your mask already filtered the air, preventing you from inhaling the particulates that swirl in the ruddy haze, but you can feel the cold.  Such storms were as much ice as dust itself, this close to the pole, and your Isolation Laminate did not provide full protection from the discomfort.  It *could*, of course.  You do not doubt that.  It just doesn&#39;t.

One of the other Daemons is suspended before you upon the rock wall, arms and legs spread.  You rise, having just secured the last restraint around its ankle.  At its side is a 2nd of your obsidian sisters, your instructions having been clear: to lock them here.  You have not questioned, and they submitted immediately.  Why?  That was not yours to know.

Instead you and the other Daemon still free leave, each in a different direction.  Yours is South still, as it has been since you left the equatorial region.  Ever South...

[[Towards the pole.-&gt;DaeEx3]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2282" name="WifeEnd3" tags="" position="3162,39427" size="100,100">&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/9l8QZNZ.png&quot; width=&quot;30%&quot; height=&quot;30%&quot;&gt;
(set: $Gear to 20)
Looking into the mirror of your boudoir, you apply the last of the gloss to your dress.  And it truly is *yours*, in a way most Torean laminate could not be claimed.  It had not been printed from a Wardrobe Device, one more blueprint shared throughout the world.  Your Master had ordered this one especially for you, to perfecting measurements, hand-crafted by the Glamoursmiths of Tarekai.  Of course you had not *met* those measurements upon that initial ordering, months ago, but a strict diet and constant exercise had prepared you for this day.  Your day, your Master&#39;s day... your wedding.

It was an offworlder&#39;s ceremony, in truth, but Master Tenyon hailed from the same stars as you did.  And this would be symbolic.  Just as your union would symbolize the galaxy beyond, as offworlders both, so too would it represent Torei-- by your slavery, and submission.  Thus the fusion ceremony and procedures, and your bare throat.  Reach up, your fingers glide against the bare flesh there.  After so long in a collar, it felt strange to be without a collar.  A very temporary situation, of course, but still.

A knock at the door behind you draws your attention back, and shifting your corset once more you turn.  &quot;Are you... ready, Miss?&quot;

The voice is that of Jakobs, your Master&#39;s attendant.  He&#39;s a freeman, but the mere fact that your Master kept a male as a servant spoke to his wealth.  It would be Jakobs who would be giving you away.

[[&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;-&gt;WifeEnd4]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2283" name="WifeEnd4" tags="" position="3163,39577" size="100,100">He enters, white chains looped over an outstretched arm, but his attention is on you alone.  &quot;You look... beautiful,&quot; the man concludes, staring openly.  Approaching, he uses his free hand to direct you in a small twirl, getting the full effect of your dress.

&quot;*Very* good,&quot; he notes.  &quot;Although I cannot imagine that corset is comfortable, hm?  I cannot imagine wearing it for...&quot; he checks the clock on the wall.  &quot;...what will be fourteen hours, or so.  Which does remind me, we should not tarry.&quot;

Jakobs shifts the forearm burdened with alabaster restraints.  &quot;Shall I?&quot;

[[&quot;Of course, Sir.&quot;-&gt;WifeEnd5]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2284" name="WifeEnd5" tags="" position="3119,39727" size="100,100">Four cuffs, two for your wrists, two for your biceps.  Guiding your hands behind your back, Jakobs secures them, a bit of time needed to properly align the gleaming chains that crisscross in an intricate pattern between them.  By the time he is done, snapping the final lock closed, your every movement induces a quiet symphony of chains rattling.  

&quot;Come then,&quot; the servant intones, grabbing the bit of chain intended for just such use.  Standing at your side, the leverage it provides allows him to direct you with ease.  His other hand reaches up, moving your veil into place before your face.  The sheer laminate hardly obstructs your features, but represented another offworlder custom.

[[You&#39;re led from your rooms.-&gt;WifeEnd6]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2285" name="WifeEnd6" tags="" position="3119,39876" size="100,100">Much of the preparation that follows is a blur of activity around you.  Slaves and free attendants move quickly through their assorted tasks, but you are required only to wait for your ordained cue.  It comes with a crescendo from the music in the Great Hall of your Master&#39;s estate, and the opening of the doors before you by a pair of liveried slaves.  

Jakobs moves immediately, and thus you do as well, his firm hand upon your restraints guiding you forward down the central hall.  The guests that turn to regard you are a veritable who&#39;s who of Arendesh Ringdom&#39;s societal elite, a display of your Master&#39;s prestige and power as grand as the richly furnished Hall itself.  Slaves are spaced along the exterior walls, another demonstration of wealth.

Yet despite the grandeur, the majority of your focus is down upon the floor.  Your heels are tall, your dress daring you to forget how restrictive its cut is, threatening to trip at any possible moment.  Jakobs would have caught you, of course, but with all eyes upon you a stumble would have been humiliating.  Unacceptable.

So you keep your eyes down, submissively, as you&#39;re led up to the dias.

[[Master Tenyon awaits.-&gt;WifeEnd77]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2286" name="WifeEnd77" tags="" position="3120,40025" size="100,100">&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/5vPIPvj.png&quot; width=&quot;30%&quot; height=&quot;30%&quot;&gt;

Your owner, your soon to be husband, is only a few years older than yourself.  That surprised many that met with him, but Master Tenyon (who went without a forename in the traditional Arendesh manner) had built his empire upon embracing the unexpected.  A self-made man born on a backwater in the Vawking Cluster, he had come to Torei upon reaching adulthood.  You&#39;ve never heard *why* exactly, but his embrace of Torei&#39;s culture-- and the unique opportunity it provided for a man with ambition-- had been immediate.  

Tenyon Imports had been built upon the untapped market deeper within Torei for offworlder goods, which still struggle to disperse far beyond the Way Up itself.  The more antipodal Ringdoms being deeply conservative remained part of the problem, but so too had been a lack of interest from the offworlders themselves.  Torei remained such a fresh frontier, at least when it came to trading, and there was wealth enough for most where it was easy to travel.

But Master Tenyon had taken risks early, building contacts far from the usual centers of trade.  Today his goods flowed steadily into the heart of the planet, even if it remained somewhat of a trickle compared to the glut that rained down upon the Mountainous Ringdoms.  Still, that success had brought him immense wealth, enough to own hundreds of slaves-- including yourself.

As you step up upon the dias, Jakobs finally releasing you, and you can seen your Master smiling.  Its slight, that shift of the firm line that is his lips, but there.  His eyes are for you alone, although all of the collected hundreds here are now upon you, drinking you in.

[[You follow the program, and kneel.-&gt;Wife8]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2287" name="Wife8" tags="" position="3119,40176" size="100,100">With your arms still bound, and your dress so demanding, it takes a bit of effort.  But you manage with grace, and your Master begins.  This is not a wedding of equals, after all, and he is not here to accept your hand-- bound as it is.  No, Master Tenyon stands above you to *claim* you, publicly, in the Arendesh and more generally Torean manner.  His speech is not long, nor are you required to speak.  Only to submit, which-- of course-- you do.  

The collar comes first, rose-gold and seamless.  When he puts it around your neck it is warm, as if he had been holding it to dispel the chill before sliding it into place upon your throat.  His hands are gentle as he does so, but firm.  Next comes the gag, a panel design in white with carefully tailored lace-like designs upon it to match your dress.  Torean bonding ceremonies often thought it proper for a bride to remain silent upon her wedding day, so that she could better consider the new position she found herself in.  And you are no exception.

When your Master finally concludes, helping you to your feet, you arise a new woman.  *His* woman, in a manner far beyond that of a mere slave.  You occupy now a position of intense prestige, offworlder in nature but infused so heavily with Torean values as to be something else altogether.  Master Tenyon sat atop a blended court riding a new edge in offworlder-Torean relations, and you will be his most cherished possession therein.

[[And you kiss.-&gt;Wife9]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2288" name="Wife9" tags="" position="3119,40326" size="100,100">His embrace is strong and commanding, but the kiss he places upon the laminate panel covering mouth is gentle.  Your eyes meet and he holds your gaze, even as he sweeps you back, inducing a dramatic pose for the vid-cams that flicker to capture the moment.  Its only when Master Tenyon releases you that you realize you had been holding your breath.

The rest of the wedding is equally a blur and tribulation.  Still bound and gagged you&#39;re not much of a conversation partner, but your husband keeps you at his side for all that follows.  Introductions and pleasantries with every guest, the reception, the tours of the estate&#39;s gardens late into the night-- hour after hour passes, and you are simply expected to endure, despite the stricture of your dress.  The corset especially proves onerous, its sharp bite leaving you abdomen sore long before fireworks cap the party.

That left only the final piece to the event: *the bedding.*

[[Reduced to perhaps a dozen, you follow on your leash to the master bedroom.-&gt;Wife10]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2289" name="Wife10" tags="" position="3119,40477" size="100,100">&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/fgT4JXc.png&quot; width=&quot;30%&quot; height=&quot;30%&quot;&gt;

Led to your wedding bed, you find another woman waiting, her laminate sheer, her full lips pulled into an inviting smirk.  You&#39;re not the only purchase Master Tenyon made from Celeste Academy.  His Doll, and that is the only name he gave her, would of course be participating in any carnal adventure with your Master.  It made sense, her presence demonstrated again for those who now line the bedchamber&#39;s walls your Master&#39;s prestige.  The only thing more expensive than a fully trained Torean slave-wife was a fully trained Academy Doll, after all.

As Torean tradition demanded your arms remain bound, but you are freed from most of your other garments as you take to the bed.  There you service your new husband and Master for several hours, the small crowd observing your skill and experience as much as his own.  By the coming of dawn you&#39;re left exhausted, as is the Doll, but one final event caps your wedding-- when Master Tenyon fits around your waist his second gift, following that of your collar.

A steel chastity belt.  Unlike the Doll, who could be used by guests, you are your Master&#39;s alone-- and he will be ensuring that fact by keeping you belted at all times.

[[And your first day as a proper Torean slave-wife ends...-&gt;Ending]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2290" name="CourEnd3" tags="" position="2164,39446" size="100,100">&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/88uSNNU.jpg&quot; width=&quot;35%&quot; height=&quot;35%&quot;&gt;

Your break ends as it began, with a sharp twinge that threatens to evolve towards a proper shock.  There is no point of origin, it rides your nerves from toes to throat, inescapable.  You could only avoid it by returning to your feet, which you do, the heavy pack locked to your back shifting uncomfortably as you do.  Upon the HUD of your mask the route you had been working on is projected before you, as well as the familiar command:

*Get to work, Courier #381*

You take a deep breath and begin walking, both of which prove difficult.  Like every Courier owned by *Full Protocol Couriers*, you wear the traditional uniform couriers engaged in full protocol work have worn on Torei for decades: a fully encapsulating laminate outfit, including a heavy duty opaque mask, and full body harness.  The latter anchored the sealed pack upon your back, spreading out its weight somewhat, while the mask ensured you could travel through any dust storm while also preventing your divulging of your route or packages to anyone, slave or free.  

The nobility of Torei still disdained technological communication, a lingering holdover from the general fear of the polar AIs, and the lack of available technology before the Way Up.  And thus full protocol couriers, such as yourself, were a popular method of sending important documents and letters in a manner that guaranteed their confidentiality.  Even today, with *glass* devices becoming more widely available, the proper way to sign a business deal or send an invitation remained couriers such as yourself.

[[Few of the nobility care about the woman locked inside your suit, of course.-&gt;CourEnd4]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2291" name="CourEnd4" tags="" position="2164,39596" size="100,100">*Route latency detected.  Deploying motivation.*

The flashing words upon your HUD push your meandering focus on Torean customs to your route, but you&#39;re not quick enough.  A shock follows, triggered by your implants and piercings, that nearly sends you to your knees.  Your moan is lost to the gag between your teeth, much less the mask however, and achieves little.  Yet a second motivator is provided moments later, your fully regulated oxygen supply suddenly growing sweet as you inhale.  A Torean Aphrodisiac that you&#39;ve come to know well is pumped in, and you have no choice but to breath deeply, your heart fluttering as it burns brightly within your chest.  You want to reach down, to play with yourself, but you know that would only bring about another shock.  So you merely walk on, at the company-standard pace, gritting your teeth in frustration.  Your suit was devious like that, providing a carrot so soon after the proverbial stick.

[[Where were you going again?-&gt;CourEnd5]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2292" name="WayUpTravel2" tags="" position="6600,16055" size="100,100">You flee.  Damn your deal, damn the consequences, damn Torei itself!  The hallways and passages connecting the buildings throughout the downtown provide you an easy enough path to follow, one that did not risk breaking curfew, but you hardly notice.  Your eyes remain forward, checking only the signs that point you onward.  Somewhere along the way you pass Corinth, missing each other in the crowd by mere moments, but your haste overrides everything else.

[[To the Elevator!-&gt;WayUpTravel3]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2293" name="WayUpTravel3" tags="" position="6600,16205" size="100,100">Eventually you arrival at a terminal building that promises free shuttles to the Way Up, operating on constant schedule-- this near the beating heart of Torean commerce, such things never slept.  The trip is undertaken in a blink of your gleaming eyes.

Like a strand of gleaming pearls suspended in the night, the Space Elevator soon stretches before you, disappearing up into the clouds.  On approach via the shuttle, you pass beyond Aekora&#39;s strict borders-- although your fractured memories allow you to piece back together that this wasn&#39;t unusual.  Many of the Ringdoms near the elevator but not directly abutting it had treaties to allow direct lines like the one you&#39;re riding to the elevator base itself.

That would mean passing through an Aekoran customs checkpoint, the last before entering into the legally distinct area maintained by the Space Elevator authority-- where Torean contracts and slavery no longer applied.  Still-- as the shuttle pulls into port, you need only look up through the glass ceiling above to see your way off Torei so very close.  Can you make it off planet?

The final customs checkpoint looms ahead of you, words painted above the series of exits making that point clear: EXITING SOVEREIGN TOREAN TERRITORY.  

[[You move towards the line that led to the Way Up itself.-&gt;WayUpTravel4]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2294" name="WayUpTravel4" tags="" position="6601,16355" size="100,100">Deep into the night, the lines snaking away from the final Aekoran checkpoint before entering the international zone abutting the Way Up proper aren&#39;t particularly long.  Most of those you watch pass through are actually *entering* the exclusion zone, in fact, which made sense given your own ticket offworld-- scheduled for midnight, a fresh ride down must have just arrived full of tourists.  Presumably the space elevator&#39;s technicians would be preparing for the reverse acent at that very moment.

Still, to pass through the checkpoint would require an absolutely spotless record.  Anything worthy of arrest would undoubtedly get you pulled aside, to be subjected to the altogether rough mercies of the Ministry of Truants.

This would be a point of no return, and your very last chance to make for your deal.

Daemon Control Suite: *the inner workings of an Isolation Laminate are a mystery even to you, sealed as you are within.  (colour: purple)[You wriggle helplessly, submitting completely to the stimulation and command.]  But you are relatively certain that a series of implants and piercings connect you directly with the suit systems, monitoring your every biometric, tweaking and teasing them as necessary.

Slave Septum Piercing: *a ring of steel embedded in your septum, this simple improvement has a variety of uses to a Torean eye.

Counterfeit Doll Binder: *a heavy laminate armbinder, this device cruelly forces your arms back and behind you.  Straps across your shoulders and chest anchor it, but heavy locks ensure you are not capable of removing it regardless.

&quot;That&#39;s an Academy Doll for you,&quot; his compatriot notes simply.  &quot;Thinking with their cunts is all they know.&quot;

&quot;All *I* know is that they&#39;re apparently worth every credit.&quot;

The more steadfast man grunts.  &quot;We make good money, but nowhere near *that* much.  She will be some noble&#39;s toy, you know that.&quot;

The younger sounding one, you recognize he&#39;s the one carrying the portion of the box within which rested your feet, laughs.  &quot;Guess so,&quot; yet he looks into your box, making eye contact.  &quot;Excited to be a little fuck toy?&quot;

Several other packages already occupy the space, but from your extremely limited vantage you don&#39;t see any other slaves-- and certainly there are no other dolls in attendance.  

The older porter goes to start the vehicle while the younger man lingers, filling out a form of some sort with a stylus upon his glass device.  You nevertheless catch him glancing your way more than once.

One of the many lessons you had been taught by the Academy had focused upon the need to know when to push a partner for action, and when to let them come to you.  After counting off a minute you open your eyes to find the man staring openly and your laminate covered body, although his gaze snaps immediately to yours upon noticing you again are looking.

[[You wink at him.-&gt;DollWink]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2335" name="DollEnd8Entice" tags="" position="1243,40644" size="100,100">Pressing against your restraints, you wriggle in your box, moaning lewdly as you feel your nipple piercings pull against the laminate of your outfit.  The man notices immediately, even if he hesitates to look your way directly.  Your training had covered how to prove alluring to women and men alike and it does not fail you now, as he does eventually look your way.  There your eyes meet.

[[Wink at him.-&gt;DollWink]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2336" name="DollWink" tags="" position="1093,40792" size="100,100">Your eyelashes are long and sultry, emphasizing the quick wink and smile you give him, the latter around the ball still wedged firmly between your teeth.  The man flushes a bit then turns, hopping off the rear of the truck in a huff.  You&#39;re left in his wake, alone once more, pleased with yourself.  As a fully trained Doll, you could not turn off that latent sensuality if you tried.

You&#39;re not given another chance with the man however, as you&#39;re transported from the Academy Campus to begin your trek to your new home and Master.  How would this *Tenyon* be?  You know from your training that he is an offworlder, but very Torean in nature, even having gone as far as to take up Torean naming practices-- apparently the Ringdom in which you would live only utilized a surname for nobility.  Thus Tenyon, with nothing preceding it.

Momentarily your thoughts are interrupted when you&#39;re transferred from sled to the promised train however.  Through your thin-lam window you catch glimpses of passengers boarding, but you and a host of other slaves are instead loaded into the undercarriage-- a dark, humid hold beneath the cars themselves.  Restraints along the floor are utilized on those who are not packed for shipment, while you merely require a few straps to hook your box to the floor.  

Eventually the loading is completed and the door closes, leaving you in the inky dark, surrounded only by the sound of other slaves.  Some moan in terror, other ecstasy-- none speak.  Gags are required in slave storage, after all.  You merely look upward, realizing in that moment that this would be your experience for the next *three weeks.*

[[And your stim array purrs, soon forcing you to join the moaning chorus.-&gt;Doll10]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2337" name="Doll10" tags="" position="1094,40942" size="100,100">Throughout your long trip, you catch only glimpses of the world outside.  Sometimes the car stops, and the cargo hatch opening nearly blinds you given your adaption to the dark.  The one time your box is actually pulled out, two Truant Officers peering at you, most of your time is spent merely blinking away the blindspots.  But you manage, and apparently pass the customs inspection-- your box is stamped with a mark of inspection, and you&#39;re returned to a train hold.  You&#39;re incapable of telling if it were the same one, but of course you hardly care.  Throughout it all your stim array purrs, and you dream of your mysterious new owner using your waiting holes.

Thus three weeks pass, and with that comes your final arrival deep in the antipodes of Torei.  You&#39;re far from the Way Up, carried into a Ringdom few offworlders made the effort to travel to.  Yet your first view of Arendesh Ringdom is perhaps disappointing, if you were expecting some strange alien land-- the Ringdom occupies the same equatorial belt of habitation as Aekora, and thus much of the foliage you see is familiar.  It is far more rural however, lacking the sleek buildings and congested sidewalks of a mountainous Ringdom.  Another transport takes you along winding roads through a massive gate, where you&#39;re then carried into what proves to be an expansive manse.

You see little of it, of course, given your limited viewport and honest lack of interest in decoration.  But you notice the occasional passing slave, and note with perceptive eyes the occasional hardpoints scattered throughout the home-- small nods allowing for bondage to occur most anywhere.  

Eventually you&#39;re deposited in a bedroom, the massive bedframe also quite Torean-- their culture put emphasize on bedroom exploits after all, having an appropriate stage was expected.  There you&#39;re left for several more hours however, alone except for a curious soubrette who looks in on you around noon-- until nightfall.

[[You wake from a drowsy sleep to see a man entering.-&gt;Doll11]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2338" name="IsClubTrav" tags="" position="2427,15599" size="100,100">With a tug on your leash, Isabella leads you out of the terminal and into what you&#39;re surprised to find is a series of interconnected pathways.  The last rays of light are slipping away, and with them the chance for most women to travel, given Aekora&#39;s curfew laws.  But by linking the shops and clubs and bars of downtown Grand Aekora, the local businesses have cleverly avoided that issue-- for walking down the glass lined boulevards allows everyone to remain technically inside.  

With that extended liberty comes crowds packing most thoroughfares, nearly everyone cloaked in glossy laminate of a thousand different designs and colors.  Even so, with your growing experience you find it quite easy to pick out the offworlders from those Torean-born or trained.  They&#39;re the rare examples of offworld textiles still being used, or gawk at those passing by.  Given the strictness of your bondage its the latter that seem to focus on you most intently, staring as a bit of drool escapes your gags to land upon your laminated breasts.  Native Toreans hardly give you a second glance, merely filing you away as one more slave among so many others being led by her owner.

And Isabella does lead, setting a quick pace marked by the harsh snap of her steel-lined stilettos upon the tiled or occasionally paved floors.  She holds her hand down to her side, the loop of your leash twisted around her wrist and gripped by her gloved hand.  Weaving through the crowds, she rarely looks back, and only then to gauge how hard to tug to keep you moving.

[[You have no choice but to follow dutifully.-&gt;IsClubTrav2]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2339" name="IsClubTrav2" tags="" position="2427,15749" size="100,100">By the time Isabella finally stops some twenty minutes later you&#39;re breathing heavily through your nose, hips wriggling from the sensation of your plugs shifting with every step taken in the quick march.  The street upon which you stand is covered like all the rest, but its the building jutting out before you that draws your attention.

Your address, your destination, is labeled with bold letters: **(colour: &quot;#e619e5&quot;)[CLUB LUSH]**.

The doorway is ornate, curling columns framing each side, seemingly rendered in glass or some other manner of transparent material.  Nearby lights enter them only to refract, spilling out in bright patterns.  It&#39;s enough to distract you momentarily from a choice that presents itself-- but eventually you focus on your immediate concerns.

Not only is the club ornate, it&#39;s guarded by a bouncer, a testament to the Club&#39;s wealth demonstrated by the fact that he&#39;s male.  To the side a short line awaits, and even a quick glance makes it obvious the clientele trends towards the elite.  The only slaves you see are attending a Mistress or Master.  Getting in that way could be pricey.

Isabella of course makes that way immediately, dragging you along behind.

[[Those in line glare as you and your Mistress skip to the front.-&gt;IsClubTrav3]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2340" name="IsClubTrav3" tags="" position="2626,15888" size="100,100">To your surprise the bouncer doesn&#39;t immediately demand you return to the back of the line, and instead looks Isabella up and down.  A moment passes, then two.

&quot;Naram-Sin?&quot;

The crimson lips of your Mistress curl into a smile, the neon surrounding you glinting off her glasses.  &quot;Good thing you didn&#39;t say Sargon.  Would you be so kind as to...?&quot;

The man leaps into action, a long muscled arm pushing open the door behind as he stands aside.  Isabella steps forward immediately, but the bouncer intervenes with his other hand.  &quot;Just as a warning, Mistress, there *is* a Sargon attending tonight.&quot;  

Isabella&#39;s smile pulls even tighter, sharp enough to cut glass, but she doesn&#39;t respond.  Instead she merely nods, and the man clears the way completely, but not without putting in a last word.  

&quot;Make sure to keep your slave on a leash, though.&quot;  He reaches to your rear as you pass, fondling you briefly through the slick laminate of your suit.

[[Sound indignant!  &quot;Mmmgh!&quot;-&gt;IsClubTrav4A]]

&quot;Hush,&quot; Isabella commands from her position before you, leading into the neon maw of Club Lush proper.  &quot;Your purpose is the pleasure of others now, my slave.&quot;

Stepping through the portal, you&#39;re greeted with a cacophony of sound and color.  Loud, pounding music thrums through your body as much as the air, matched with the flash of strobes and other lights.  Most of the coloration trends towards violet, adding to the otherwise dim atmosphere-- while reflecting brilliantly off the multitudes in attendance.  

Laminate in a thousand different forms glisten before your eyes, each more elaborate or revealing then the last.  The Club is a hive of activity, all of Torei seemingly condensed into this one place: Mistresses and Masters  attended by slaves, tourists gawking at every passing sight, and spread liberally throughout freewombs and other such independents.  Some are seated at the small tables near the center of the room, awash in the glow of neon, while others crowd the stage up front.  Along the edges booths allow for a more intimate audience, shadows hiding most of what went on there beyond the occasional flash of laminate.

Turning about slowly, you momentarily lose yourself in the madness of sensuality that perhaps best personified Torei.  As if to remind you of your place in it all, Lush gives one last look at your current condition via the mirrors flanking the door.  Your heeled boots put you on display as much as anyone else, the posture required of them setting of your suit brilliantly-- which gleams like an obsidian ocean, each blast of color from the club itself running down your curvaceous form.  Your bolero style straitjacket renders you incapable of much resistance, while your gags deny speech-- while your plugs shift uncomfortably as your muscles contract, squeezing them within you.  You hardly recognize yourself, or how you feel... knowing only that altogether it makes you so very wet.

Your heeled boots put you on display as much as anyone else, the posture required of them setting of your suit brilliantly-- which gleams like an obsidian ocean, each blast of color from the club itself running down your curvaceous form.  Your bolero style straitjacket renders you incapable of much resistance, while your gags deny speech-- while your plugs shift uncomfortably as your muscles contract, squeezing them within you.  You hardly recognize yourself, or how you feel... knowing only that altogether it makes you so very wet.  

[[Gaze long into the abyss...-&gt;MeetCherishIsa]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2343" name="MeetCherishIsa" tags="" position="2636,16180" size="100,100">As you look into the mirror Isabella turns, coming up alongside you.  Your leash goes momentarily limp, hanging down between your breasts until it bends, leading to the arm that your Mistress wraps around your corseted waist.  Her other aims higher, the fingertips of her hand landing lightly beneath your chin.  Such a soft touch nevertheless induces you to raise your head without a command ever being spoken, while your black-clad form is pressed against by your Mistress&#39; similarly colored outfit.  

Where yours is an exercise in submission, however, Isabella remains an image of Torean domination personified.  She wears it so naturally, as if such aggressive sensuality was her natural state, coming as easily as breathing.

&quot;I must underline the fact that I am *quite* pleased you took up my offer, unorthodox as it may have seemed,&quot; your Mistress purrs, meeting your gaze through the mirror.  &quot;What you think about things no longer *needs* to matter, but I am curious if you&#39;re enjoying being reduced... to what you are.  **Mine.**&quot;

[[Nod your head.  Yes...-&gt;MeetCherishYYY]]
[[Shake your head.  No!-&gt;MeetCherishNNN]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2344" name="MeetCherishYYY" tags="" position="2561,16330" size="100,100">&quot;The trick,&quot; Isabella muses, her eyes twinkling brightly, &quot;is that I really didn&#39;t need to ask.  I could just unzip you right now, pull out your front insert, and watch as you drip all over the ground.  Like the little slut I *knew* you were, the moment I saw you in that hotel.&quot;

Her smile is deep with knowing.  She&#39;s right, of course.

&quot;There is no shame in it.  Slaves cannot help themselves.  That&#39;s something you offworlders always struggle to learn.  Until they&#39;re locked into laminate, and cumming their brains out...&quot;

Her smile is deep with knowing.  She&#39;s right, of course.

&quot;There is no shame in it.  Slaves cannot help themselves.  That&#39;s something you offworlders always struggle to learn.  Until they&#39;re locked into laminate, and cumming their brains out...&quot;

&quot;**Breathtaking**, right?&quot;

It&#39;s only then, the words spoken over your shoulder, that you notice a woman had stepped up behind you.  Isabella turns her head to regard her, while you see that she is uniformed-- in tight laminate.  Surrounded by the violet hues of the club, her servant&#39;s livery matches nicely in it&#39;s light shade of blue, being tight across her chest before expanding to a very short skirt.  Just how short it is she demonstrates by lifting it for you while bowing.  You recognize it from your time with Isabella as a very well practiced Torean reverence.

&quot;I saw you observing yourself in the mirror,&quot; she explains, speaking to Isabella alone as she smooths out her skirt and petticoats, &quot;and I just had to say it, Mistress.  You wear laminate well, as does your slave.  Ah, but where are my manners?  Allow me to welcome you to Club Lush, my name is Cherish.  As a slave of this establishment, please allow me to service you in whatever manner you deem me capable of.&quot;

Her collar is thin, pulled tight against her throat, fashionable-- and without an observable way for it to be removed.

&quot;Tell me of your services,&quot; Isabella commands.

[[And Cherish obeys.-&gt;MeetCIsa4]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2347" name="MeetCIsa4" tags="" position="2637,16624" size="100,100">&quot;First time at Lush?&quot;  She winks.  &quot;No problem, Mistress.  Let me run you through the various services we offer here, alright?&quot;

She steps more directly to Isabella&#39;s side, allowing her white gloved hand to be more easily followed as she uses it to direct both your gazes.  &quot;Most of our guests start at the bar, which is fully stocked with a range of drinks-- both alcoholic and otherwise-- sourced from all over Torei, as well as a selection imported from the Offworlders.  Or if you like, you may take a seat at a table or booth.  Built into each is a button you can use to call the nearest available slave at your convenience, as well as to reward or punish us as you deem necessary.&quot;

Just what *that* meant isn&#39;t clear, as Cherish turns you towards the mouth of a hallway that disappears into darkness-- a bright pink neon sign above shaped like a pillow.  &quot;We also provide several private rooms, outfitted with lounging areas and bed, rented by the hour.  Many freewombs utilize them to solicit their betters, but for the right price you can also rent me-- or any of the other slaves in-uniform for the night, if you like.&quot;  Another wink.  &quot;Restraints included, of course.&quot;

Finally she casts her attention upward, to the second story balcony overlooking the stage.  &quot;And that would be our VIP area.  Invitations are *quite* hard for most to come by, but I have been made aware that you are a Naram-Sin, Mistress?  If you wish, it would be my pleasure to seat you there immediately.&quot;

Isabella glances about, then produces your identification card.  The SLAVE stamp along the top still looks fresh.  &quot;First things first, I believe there is someone here expecting my slave.  You will tell me if this is true.

[[Cherish takes the card.-&gt;MeetCIsa5]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2348" name="MeetCIsa5" tags="" position="2637,16774" size="100,100">&quot;Ah, of course!  If I could borrow the identification card, I can check to see where your party is waiting?  I just need to stop at the bar, I will be right back.&quot;

Taking your card, Cherish moves just as indicated, allowing you to watch her go.  Her swaying hips shift her skirt just *so*, revealing the triple hints of white that are her panties, petticoats, and garters.  You note Isabella watching just as much as you do.  At Cherish&#39;s return, however, you sense an incoming problem.

&quot;Mistress,&quot; she begins, &quot;the good news is that we did have your name on record.  Your party is waiting in our VIP Suite #4... but they did not provide authorization for you to ascend, and have an outstanding do-not-disturb order.  Obviously you are freely invited to enter our VIP area at your will, but you will need to make contact yourself.&quot;

Isabella nods, sliding your ID back into her purse.  &quot;Very good.  One more thing, slave.  Where is the Sargon in attendance tonight?&quot;

[[Cherish tenses up just a bit.-&gt;MeetCIsa6]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2349" name="MeetCIsa6" tags="" position="2637,16924" size="100,100">The serving girl adjusts her glasses, Torean biomedical prowess meaning they *had* to just be for decoration.  Then she first indicates a woman seated primly at one of the private booths along the wall.  Alone, she would have been obscured by the shadows there were it not for the bright holographic image displayed before her-- although you&#39;re too far away to make out what it depicted.  &quot;Mistress Tysus Sargon, of House Sargon.  She is a scholar of some sort, as I--&quot;

&quot;A scholar of *Daemons*,&quot; Isabella interrupts with a frown.  &quot;I am well aware.&quot;

Cherish takes the interruption in stride, but her tone shifts to worry.  &quot;Then I would hope, Mistress, that you&#39;re aware that Club Lush certainly wishes no incidents between the ruling families of our Ringdom to occur beneath its roof?  My Master is on good terms with both House Sargon and House Naram-Sin.&quot;

Isabella waves away her concern without a second thought.  &quot;It is none of your concern, slave, but you needn&#39;t worry.&quot;

Tugging on your leash, your Mistress leads you directly towards the seated Sargon.  

[[You are forced to follow.-&gt;Sargon1]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2350" name="Sargon1" tags="Variables" position="2637,17073" size="100,100">&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/iSfchkz.jpg&quot; width=&quot;40%&quot; height=&quot;40%&quot;&gt;

From the vantage of your approach, you get your first good look at Tysus Sargon.  She&#39;s seated alone in the center of a crescent-shaped booth, the plush dark material drinking in the light of the club.  She would have been all but invisible had she not been focused on a haptic display projected before her, massive data tables running down before her as she leans in, adjusting black-rimmed glasses.
(set: $Isasked to false)
As should have perhaps been expected, her outfit is pure laminate, the strictly business look of her pencil skirt offset by the semi-transparent material of the shirt she wears, the front pulled open exposing the bra worn underneath.  That mixture of serious scholarship and playful sensuality seems to define her, from the outfit to her hair, black strands pulled into a tight bun-- but offset, producing an appeal asymmetrical effect.

At that moment she holds a stylus in her hand, tapping it gently against blood-red lips.  There is absolutely no doubt in your mind that she had failed to notice Isabella&#39;s approach, which could only mean she was ignoring you both deliberately.  Unwilling to play any such game, Isabella seats herself at the table without invitation.  A snapped finger pointed towards the floor is all the direction you&#39;re given.

[[Take a seat on the floor.-&gt;Sargon2Fail]]
[[Kneel, legs spread.-&gt;Sargon2Pass]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2351" name="Sargon2Fail" tags="" position="2562,17223" size="100,100">Denied a proper seat at the table, as a slave, you instead move to take a similar position on the floor.  Isabella interrupts you with a stern look however, her narrowed eyes promising great discomfort if you did not adjust immediately.  It takes a moment, but you remember your time on the train with her-- and take a kneeling position instead, legs spread.  The submissive posture marks you as one of the enslaved in attendance, a quick glance around the Club allowing you to notice a few others enduring similar treatment.

Up above, Tysus finally looks to Isabella.

&quot;Naram-Sin.&quot;

&quot;Sargon.&quot;

The tension is palpable, and you recognize immediately an intense hatred-- perhaps even rivalry.  It smolders between them as Tysus forces the hologram before her away, leaning forward over the table to glare at Isabella more intensely.  Yet your Mistress answers in a way that surprises the other woman, when she produces an object between gloved fingers: the Black Card you had found in your hotel room this morning.

Immediately Tysus shifts, eyes widening.  &quot;Where did you get that?&quot;

[[Isabella&#39;s smile is predatory.-&gt;Sargon3]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2352" name="Sargon2Pass" tags="" position="2712,17222" size="100,100">Denied a proper seat at the table, as a slave, you take a position upon the floor, kneeling with legs spread.

She indicates you with a tilt of her head.  &quot;An offworlder,&quot; Tysus scoffs at that, but Isabella presses on, &quot;who nevertheless has taken very well to our culture.  She knows her place better than most Torean girls.&quot;

Isabella&#39;s gaze shifts to you more directly.  &quot;Demonstrate your submission.&quot;

A test, you imagine, as much as a way to prove her point to Tysus.

[[Put your head to the floor, present your rear.-&gt;Sargon4Rear]]

The posture pulls the laminate crossing your rear even tighter, forcing the phallus anchored to it even deeper between your cheeks-- a sensation that&#39;s furthered by the hand that lands upon you.  You&#39;re not sure which of them does so, but two fingers press against the base of your insert, drilling you even harder with it.  

You cannot help but moan through both your gags in response, wriggling impotently.  

&quot;She is certainly shapely,&quot; Tysus concludes, grudgingly giving way to Isabella&#39;s point.  &quot;But that does not explain the Black Card.  There has been the sightings of a Daemon nearby, but that would mean... unless...&quot;

&quot;It is my slave&#39;s,&quot; Isabella nods, as you retake your earlier kneeling position.  She explains an even smaller portion of your story than you had given her, and you get the sense she is loathe to share even that with Tysus.  But she does speak of your amnesia, of what you had originally set out to do-- and how that had all changed with the collar around your throat.  As Isabella concludes, Tysus looks you over for several moments.

&quot;Pull her gag,&quot; she says, with a tone that made it more a command that a request.  Isabella&#39;s brows drop as she removes her glasses.  Tysus sighs, exasperated, and explains further.  &quot;Pull the girl&#39;s gag, and I will answer her questions on Daemons-- because I know you Naram-Sin are too proud to do so yourselves.  So you will listen, Isabella, and perhaps learn something.  Then we will discuss how to handle the situation.  *Together.*&quot;

Your Mistress considers the offer for a long moment, but then reaches down.  Sliding the cock insert from between your lips, she wipes it against your cheek to clean off the drool, then sets it on the table.  The ring gag is next, being pulled free after being unclipped.  Your jaw complains immediately soreness announcing itself as your teeth come together for the first time in over an hour.

The shiny steel of the heel and underside of her boot change to smooth laminate as it runs up her leg, and its to the latter you press your cunt.  Even that slight contact shifts your vaginal insert, inducing a soft ecstasy that takes the form of a moan through both your gags, as you wriggle impotently. 

&quot;She is certainly a horny thing,&quot; Tysus concludes, grudgingly giving way to Isabella&#39;s point.  &quot;But that does not explain the Black Card.  There has been the sightings of a Daemon nearby, but that would mean... unless...&quot;

The first is dependent on your slave, she must simply reject the offer-- whatever it may be-- that the presumed Daemon makes.  It would be even better if an alternative tribute was given, another slave... that would be all that is needed.  But we will make do with the second part, instead.  And that is entirely dependent on *me*.&quot;

From beneath the table she pulls forth a small transparent rectangle, a display engaging within.  A *glass* device.  &quot;The polar AIs can be relentless when they seek something-- or someone-- but one new slave is hardly something worth considerable effort on their part, barring extreme circumstances.  And as I am sure you&#39;re aware, it is *my* family that handles negotiation with the AIs on behalf of the Ringdom.  With your slave&#39;s documented refusal, and a simple authorization from my glass to have her name brought up during the next round of discussions, I&#39;m sure the AI&#39;s focus will turn elsewhere.&quot;  She taps the table for emphasis.  &quot;But you need my glass.  So...&quot;

Her eyes narrow, and in that instant you feel a chill run down your spine.  &quot;...the Daemon will recognize if your slave comes to the deal with her Mistress, they respect such a relationship.  I will accompany, to observe and collect data, posing as another of your household.  Once we complete the meeting, I will authorize as promised, and everyone can go their separate ways.&quot;

Despite all their posturing, it does almost seem fair-- if Tysus could be trusted throughout.  &quot;Oh,&quot; she continues, &quot;there is one small matter as well, you and I, Isabella, should take a quick run through a wardrobe to coordinate our outfits.  To sell the ruse more easily, yes?&quot;

&quot;No need.&quot;  Tysus points to the balcony overlooking the lower floor of Club Lush, upon which you kneel.  Isabella&#39;s gaze follows her hand, but your attention falls on Tysus&#39; other, typing quickly on her glass.  Strange.  &quot;I already have a room, suite #2.  We can use mine.  It would be no problem whatsoever.&quot;

*Something* is wrong, you can feel it.  The subtle dance of Torean dominance is playing out before you, and you&#39;re tied intrinsically to Isabella.  Perhaps... perhaps you should try to warn her.  Even if you don&#39;t know about what.

Cherish, the serving slave you had met at the entrance of the Club, lifts her skirt and performs a deep reverence for both Isabella and Tysus.  You, of course, are generally ignored.

&quot;How can I be of service?&quot;

&quot;Leave us,&quot; Tysus replies, &quot;you were not summoned.&quot;

&quot;Actually she was.&quot;  Isabella smiles, withdrawing her hand from the small console set into the table.  You imagine it is some sort of paging system for the slaves of the Club.  &quot;Cherish, take my slave to the bar, get her something to eat while we finish our discussion.  She has had a long day, and I would not have her passing out on me before we conclude our business tonight.&quot;

As she hands the serving girl your leash, Cherish nods brightly.  &quot;Of course, Mistress! Is there something in particular you had in mind for her?&quot;

Isabella withdraws her hand with a shrug.  &quot;Whatever slave slurry you are offering.  My property is not allowed solids.&quot;

Just what *that* meant is not explained, as Cherish bows once more in acknowledgement, then grips your leash tightly.  She may be wearing a collar too, but that doesn&#39;t make her anymore gentle.  &quot;Come along then, slave.&quot;

But if you stared too long at that tempting sight you were liable to run into another patron, leash guiding you or not, and you do make a concentrated effort to focus just as you approach the bar itself.

Forged mainly of glass, the Club&#39;s lights dance through the material, inducing a bright glow that&#39;s eclipsed by the row of laminate-clad patrons lined up before it.  Cherish guides you to the side, a position that must be reserved for slaves of the Club itself, but to your surprise she makes no effort to feed you as ordered.  Instead she hands a small plastic chit she held in her hand to the bartender, who holds it up briefly to the light before slipping it inside his glass device.  Reading the message there, he squints at you, but then looks back to Cherish.  A knowing nod passes between them, and she promptly leads you away from the bar.

[[What is happening!?-&gt;Sargon12]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2367" name="Sargon12" tags="" position="2614,18714" size="100,100">Moving quickly now, Cherish skirts the edge of the Club, as far from your Mistress and Tysus as possible.  Approaching the stage upon which the live band roared she directs you to a side entrance, marked CLUB SLAVES/EMPLOYEES ONLY.  Pushing through reveals a backroom, although Cherish doesn&#39;t allow you time to gawk.  She continues moving quickly, passing several rooms in succession.  From one you hear gagged moaning, and in another you see lines of cages, but she presses on-- unlocking a door by allowing her collar to be scanned, then ascending a staircase.  Your mastery of stairs while heeled so aggressively is not nearly as advanced as Cherish&#39;s own, which she recognizes, slowing for the first time so you can make the climb without falling-- being without usable arms certainly hurt your balance!

But you persevere, and together you spill out yet another door to find yourself on a balcony.  This one you recognize as the VIP area Cherish had pointed out before, overlooking the rest of the club itself.  A handful of plush seating areas are occupied, but its towards the hallway along the back wall that you&#39;re lead.  Here the doors are numbered, one through six, and you suddenly realize where you are: the private rooms both Cherish and Tysus had mentioned.  Apparently your deal was to take place in #4, but its at #2 that you stop.  Tysus&#39; room.

With a final click your arms are suddenly no longer strictly bound, and by lifting them Cherish maneuvers the tight laminate from your body.  The black of your catsuit remains of course, but you can wriggle your fingers and shake out the ache in your arms-- had the other slave not been so hurried.

&quot;Mistress Isabella did not explain *why* you&#39;re to be allowed this, but I *will* come in for you in ten minutes, and you *must* put back on your straitjacket.  Before anyone else gets suspicious.  When nobles play these games if they go wrong the slaves always get punish, and I&#39;m sure neither of us want to get into trouble...&quot;

Your concerns are altogether different, of course.  Isabella must have passed a note chit of some sort while handing off your leash, but to what purpose?  Clearly she intended for you to search out something within Tysus&#39; room.  What had they discussed?  Their plan for you and your supposed Daemon had focused on meeting with it together, you denying it a deal, and then Tysus sending word to her family to ensure your freedom to remain Isabella&#39;s slave would be made clear to the polar AIs in whatever manner the Ringdom used to negotiate with them.  What did that have to do with a clandestine exploration of Tysus&#39; room?  Perhaps you should have paid more attention, but you cannot wait any longer-- time is running out!

The rectangular device is latched but not locked, and upon opening it you find the interior split into two sides: the first holds a thick stack of thin-lam sheets.  Looking through them would take some time.

Twin doors, one to each side pull open at your gloved touch to reveal... a *massive* selection of bondage implements.  Restraints, gags, whips, vibes-- the assortment appears endless.  Glancing over your shoulder, back to the bed, you consider that perhaps you should have anticipated this.  A Wardrobe Device could do much, but switching bondage implements was often done by hand-- both for convenience and to save time.  It made sense that a VIP suite would be properly outfitted in such a manner.

As your eyes drink in the toolbox of pleasure and torture before you, however, you cannot help but draw your attention to one of the vibrating wands near the front.  After being marched by Isabella across half Grand Aekora, after so much teasing... this could be your chance for release.  *Finally.*  Yet even primed as you are, you know your slave suit was built to prevent just such simple stimulations.  It would eat *considerable* time up if you let it-- not to mention risk your Mistress&#39; wrath.

*Despite all their posturing, it does almost seem fair-- if Tysus could be trusted throughout.  &quot;Oh,&quot; she continues, &quot;there is one small matter as well, you and I, Isabella, should take a quick run through a wardrobe to coordinate our outfits.

It takes you a few moments to parse out exactly what the warning meant, but you come to realize its a confirmation of a simple tweak to the Wardrobe&#39;s identification array.  A remotely delivered command has rigged the machine to quietly override any settings made by an *Isabella Naram-Sin*, replacing them instead with a slave suit to match your own-- down to the dual gags and straitjacket!

This must be Tysus&#39; plan: she had mentioned the Daemon you are to meet would accept a Mistress accompanying its slave... clearly she intended for herself to take that role, while you and Isabella would be led in as the slaves... perhaps to both be sacrificed to the Daemon&#39;s attentions!  The nerve of the woman!  But now *you* have control of what came next.

You see no means of canceling the ovveride completely, but you could take more radical action, and turn the tables on Tysus completely... by overriding the Wardrobe so that when *she* entered it her choices would be replaced with a full slave suit.

(if: $IsTask is 0)[Along the way you cannot help but glance at Isabella, knowing that the task she sent you on had undoubtedly not gone as she would like.  If you were without your gag you could have warned her, but as it is you can merely suckle on the cock heled between your hungry lips, tongue running up the base of the laminate shaft in thought.](else:)[Along the way you cannot help but glance at Tysus, knowing the task your Mistress had sent you on would catch the scheming noble in a trap of her own design.  The irony is delicious, although your tongue has a taste only for the laminate cock locked between your hungry lips.  Suckling on it slowly, you smile as best you gags can manage.]

Reaching the VIP landing itself reveals it to be much as you left it, a handful of Club-goers seated in the lounge area or along the balcony to overlook the Lush itself.  Isabella and Tysus press onward however, entering the darkened hallway with its neon markers.  Behind the door marked as Suite #4 you could expect a Daemon, but it is towards Tysus&#39; room at #2 that they aim.

[[Your plugs shift with anticipation.-&gt;IsaWar2]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2410" name="IsaWar2" tags="" position="3925,20449" size="100,100">Tysus unlocks the door and leads the way inside, followed by Isabella and then yourself.  Upon entering you find the Sargon (if: $Brief is true)[looking down at the briefcase you had left upon the couch, a frown upon her lips.  Yet she seems to conclude it to have simply slipped her mind, and quickly she closes the case.](else:)[waiting impatiently, even thought it has been mere moments.  You can only imagine how strict she would be as a Mistress.]

&quot;The Wardrobe is over here,&quot; she indicates the Meeting Room, (if: $Activateward is true)[&quot;All I need to do is... ah.&quot;  

She had noticed the Wardrobe has been opened(if: $Brief is true)[ as well].  You can almost read the questions running across her features.  Had she left it open?  Could the command she had sent to it have disengaged the door?  For a brief moment she almost seems liable to change course, to abandon her plan, but a glance at Isabella settles her resolve.  The disdain there is palpable.](else:)[&quot;All I need to do is open it from the other room.  One moment.&quot;

From your vantage you observe her entering the bedroom, where a quick flash of her hand above the nightstand&#39;s light engages a control console.  Her efforts are rewarded by a click from the other room to your right, as the wall at the far side of the room recedes to reveal just as she had promised: a wardrobe device.]

&quot;Come now,&quot; she continues, crossing back to the antechamber so that she can lead you and Isabella both towards the machine.  Once there, she taps upon the screen to activate it.  (if: $IsTask is 0)[&quot;Isabella, would you like to go first?&quot;

&quot;Of course,&quot; your Mistress nods.  &quot;As long as you allow me to see the settings you have made?  We are simply going for coordination, after all.&quot;

Tysus&#39; smile is sickly sweet.  &quot;Please do so.&quot;](else:)[&quot;I will go first, Isabella.  As a demonstration of our shared commitment to seeing this done right.&quot;

Isabella&#39;s smile is sickly sweet.  &quot;Please do so.&quot;]

(if: $IsTask is 0)[[[Isabella checks, nods, and enters the machine.-&gt;Taskfail]]](else:)[[[Tysus checks, nods, and enters the machine.-&gt;TaskPass]]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2411" name="Taskfail" tags="" position="3850,20599" size="100,100">&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/iSsfeuO.jpg&quot; width=&quot;40%&quot; height=&quot;40%&quot;&gt;

Even muffled within, you hear Isabella&#39;s shouts of concern.  Shock, anger-- then muffled groans.  She had been gagged, you suspect.

What emerges afterward is hard to identify as your steely-eyed Mistress.  The base of her outfit remains a black catsuit, but her every liberty is now as restrained as your own.  From the pair of gags, ring and cock, seated in her mouth to the collar at her throat, from the bolero straitjacket holding her arms beneath her breasts to the way her hips shift with the obvious signs of plugs being installed, you recognize in that moment just how quickly Torei&#39;s laminate embrace could turn on a person.  Isabella has been installed with a slave suit, and now you&#39;re *both* at Tysus mercy.

&quot;Oh my,&quot; the Sargon grins, white teeth dazzling as she observes her handiwork.  &quot;Now this... *this* is the proper look for a Naram-Sin, I think.&quot;

Isabella growls angrily through her gag, trying to pull free from the heavy laminate of her straitjacket, but all that does is shift the plugs between her legs.  The result pushes her towards a moan, although she bites down on the sound hard.

Tysus meanwhile gloats openly.  &quot;Shush now.  None of this growling, you should be looking to your slave for how to act-- now that you&#39;re in a collar too.&quot;  Pulling Isabella closer, she wraps one arm around your bound Mistress, and another around your similarly restrained shoulders as she looks to you.  &quot;Isn&#39;t that right, slave?&quot;

With a flick the top ignites a pure crimson, glowing brighter as she breaths in deeply.  Her exhale comes with laugh.  &quot;I suspected as much, but her offering to go first confirmed it.&quot;

Returning her attention to the machine, Isabella takes a patient posture.  &quot;Let us see what Tysus has gotten *herself* into.&quot;

She does not need to wait long for the first sign of concern from within, the other woman&#39;s shrill voice escaping despite the sound-dampened doors.  Something like a command to halt, at once, is given-- followed shortly thereafter by rising anger, then curses directed at the Naram-Sin in general and Isabella in particular.  That continues for some time until the words cut off mid-sentence, giving blissful silence for a few brief moments.  By then the Wardrobe had nearly completed its work, however, and the door&#39;s opening comes quickly.

After a few seconds you&#39;re panting from the effort, and after that comes a hungry moan you cannot hold.  Tysus laughs, slapping both you and Isabella on the rear.  Your Mistress straightens, furious.  But what can she do now?

&quot;Oh, this is *delightful.*&quot;  Reaching for your leash, she quickly ties the side usually used for holding to Isabella&#39;s collar than grabs the space between.  Given the length of the laminate cord you&#39;re drawn together, shoulder to shoulder, where Isabella finally looks to you.  There is anger there, burning as strong as the cinnamon cigarettes she favored, but something else too.  *Disappointment.*  She put her trust in you, and you have failed her.  Just what that meant is quickly established by Tysus, who looks between you almost giddy with excitement.  

&quot;I suppose we can toss the rest of that horrid original plan.  Why waste such a valuable opportunity?  We will still of course be going to meet your Daemon, but instead of rejecting it... well, you don&#39;t really have a choice now, do you slave?&quot;  The look she gives you makes it clear you would not have your gag removed to answer properly.

Despite herself, and to her evident frustration, Isabella joins you in moaning openly to the fondling.  For a brief moment you can imagine Tysus guiding you and Isabella towards climax, but that fantasy is broken as the Sargon suddenly steps away.

She doesn&#39;t go far, merely to the couch where (if: $Brief is true)[she once more opens her briefcase](else:)[withdraws a briefcase from beneath and opens it].  Rummaging through its contents, she quickly returns with (if: $Brief is true)[something you had missed in your first search, ]a small syringe.  

Instead of explaining her intent, or even giving you a moment to gawk, she merely steps up beside you and drives it into your neck.  The laminate is pierced easily enough, and the pain isn&#39;t too bad, but your wide eyed expression clearly announces what your gag prevents you from saying: *just what was that!?*  Tysus answers, but only after repeating the process with Isabella-- who fights her considerably, albeit vainly given her bondage.

&quot;That was a bio-chem tracking cocktail.  It does not remain potent for long, but anything more substantial would certainly be found when I give you to it.&quot;  Tossing the syringe carelessly onto the couch, she grabs the laminate cord between your throat and Isabella&#39;s before continuing.  &quot;The Daemon, I mean.&quot;

Again Isabella fights, raging against the fate you had a hand in delivering, but the Sargon had gripped the leash fiercely-- and now uses it to pull both of you towards the door.  

&quot;Come along now, slaves.  Think of the revelations this will result in!&quot;

[[Straitjacketed and gagged, you have no hope of resisting.-&gt;Fail3]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2417" name="Fail2Stub" tags="" position="3928,20909" size="100,100">&quot;Oh, very good,&quot; Tysus continues, despite your recalcitrance.

With you in tow, and all but dragging Isabella, she leads you from her suite and back into the hallway.  There isn&#39;t even hope for someone to see you, to come to your rescue-- collared and dressed in slave gear, no proper Torean would think twice about a Mistress treating you harshly.  

Nor is your destination far.  Moving two doors down takes a bit, given Isabella&#39;s growled resistance, but Tysus is just as stubborn-- and has the advantage of usable arms and leverage.  Eventually she manages to push you and your Mistress up against the wall beside the door to Suite #4, holding you there as she knocks upon the door.  Once, twice-- and when that does fail with the toe of her heeled boot, inducing *quite* a racket.

The door opens suddenly in response, revealing a bespectacled young man looking more than a little harried.  &quot;Ah, you&#39;re-- wait.  You&#39;re not she.  I&#39;m sorry, you must have the wrong--&quot;

&quot;A Daemon-Worshipper?&quot;  Tysus interrupts, leaning in.  Her words clearly spark panic in the young man, who holds up his hands, shaking his head.

&quot;Of course not, I&#39;m just staying here for--&quot;

Pushing her way past him and into the room, Tysus maintains her hold on your leash, thus pulling you both along.  The man only sees you then, his concern still evident but now once more mixed with confusion.

[[Try to get him to help!  &quot;Mmmghh!&quot;-&gt;Fail4]]
[[Try to escape Tysus&#39; hold!-&gt;Fail4]]

You and Isabella are brought together by the maneuver, chest to chest, where you can see the alarm in her eyes.  The Sargon controlling you both watches you both closely, even as she addresses the man again.  &quot;One of them, I presume, you gaze a Black Card to?  They both have come to answer it.&quot;

That *does* seem to calm the man a bit, although he never shakes that lingering look of prey being hunted.  His attire is laminate, a smart suitcoat and tailored trousers rendered in dark grey.  His tie is undone however, a bit of dishevelment shared by the antechamber you&#39;ve entered into.  Much like Tysus&#39; suite, this one features two doors leading off, although the one to the bedroom is closed.  

Its Tysus that notices a suitcase near the door however, the entire front opened to reveal a set of restraints, clearly positioned for someone to be folded up and locked within.  &quot;Ah,&quot; she notes.  &quot;Clever.  I was wondering how you got it into the Club without my seeing, or without the management throwing you out for that matter.  You *do* have some pact with the AIs.&quot;

The man eyes her carefully, adjusting his glasses.  &quot;You certainly... know a lot about how this sort of thing is done... you are...?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Tysus replies sharply.  &quot;I do not worship Daemons, I am here merely to deliver the girl you were waiting for-- alongside a bonus.  Which perhaps we will need to discuss afterward, I may not work with the AI but I would be interested in a reward for... this gift I give them.&quot;

&quot;They can be most generous!&quot;  The man enthuses, glad to be on the same page.  &quot;If you would just lead them to the door?&quot;

[[He indicates the bedroom, which Tysus strides towards immediately.  You can see the smile on her lips.-&gt;Fail5]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2420" name="Fail5" tags="" position="3860,21356" size="100,100">&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/rFMXUfL.jpg&quot; width=&quot;30%&quot; height=&quot;30%&quot;&gt;

The Daemon, the Emissary, waits for you in the center of the room.  (if: $Daemon is true)[You saw it before, in that alleyway back on the streets, and its much the same as you had glimpsed there.] Its body is uniformly covered in black laminate, stripping it of any individuality or sense of self.  There is no discernable face, only the glossy material remains, stretched so tightly across a male frame as evidenced by narrow hips and wide shoulders. Even so that masculinity is *intense*, as if the Daemon condensed it, adding potency as everything else was stripped away.  In that wake of simplified existance you feel your own curvaceous body all the more readily.  The swell of your breasts, the smooth run from hip to waist, your pert rear-- the other side of the Daemon&#39;s equation.

It reaches out its hand, and in quiet awe Tysus hands over your shared leash with Isabella.  The Daemon&#39;s grip is firm, and far stronger than you had anticipated.  It demands your full attention but does not abuse it, instead simply leading you over to the bed where two distinct sets of gear lay upon it.

Two suits.  Black as a night without stars, yet so very reflective, promising to fill that void with sources of light all its own.  Smooth.  Glossy.  Featureless and all-consuming.  And yet... *familiar*.  Standing there before them, it takes you awhile, but you recognize it in the one on the left.  That... was no ordinary suit.  This was *your* isolation suit.  Careful measurement could have confirmed it, but your gut reaction is more then enough, akin to looking into a mirror.  A mirror just like that one you awoke to this morning in that hotel, a mirror you gaze into deeply, seeing not your own reflection but something... else.  A shadow of pleasure and ecstasy.

The male lifts the helmet of that one, split into two portions yet lacking any hint of a seam.  Within you see the impression of a face-- your face.  

[[And with it comes recollection.-&gt;Fail6]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2421" name="Fail6" tags="" position="3860,21506" size="100,100">There were never material riches in this deal, and this isn&#39;t your first time on Torei.  As Corinth had suggested, you had come to this planet once, then twice, then again and again-- utterly enthralled by its possibilities.  But you had never indulged, Corinth and the hotel worker had made that clear as well.  An odd mixture of intrigue and restraint, perhaps that was what had drawn them to you.  The polar AIs, through their Daemon, with an offer you came to fear you would not-- could not-- refuse.  

Thus the Mem-Burn, the self-bondage.  A last desperate attempt to run out the clock, to force the missing of this rendezvous and drive you once more to the Way Up, this time without reason to return.  But you had underestimated Torei and its denizens, the will that had driven you to this point now subjugated entirely. You no longer have the means to accept a deal.  It would instead be forced upon you and Isabella both, as had been done to slaves on Torei again and again...

[[The helmet is yours, forever...-&gt;Fail7]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2422" name="Fail7" tags="End-Count" position="3860,21656" size="100,100">&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/RgEruqK.png&quot; width=&quot;30%&quot; height=&quot;30%&quot;&gt;

You cannot escape, or resist.  When you shake your head it steadies you.  Slowly, ever so slowly, it brings it up towards your waiting face.  How could it this easy, to lose everything?  But it is.  Damn it all, it&#39;s as easy as pressing the helmet to your face.  Closer and closer, until finally-- with glorious finality, you feel the impossibly soft laminate of the AI&#39;s construction for the very first time.  It envelopes your lips, your nose, your chin-- then your entire head in its cool embrace.  You&#39;re blinded, gagged, deaf, helpless, even as you feel the Daemon moving the back portion into place to complete the seal.

Afterward he presses against you, masculinity and femininity joining in rapturous union that takes the form of a simple embrace.  Even this first experience feels so strange, so wonderful, so terrifying-- and its only just begun.  You barely hear Isabella struggling to escape sometime later, her failure, her own  mask being applied...

Your Isolation Laminate is as perfect as you had been lead to believe.  Moreso even.  The experience of wearing it, in its entirety, is beyond description.  You&#39;re not sure if the straitjacket you wear is the one you entered the room with, or an alteration made by the power that now compels you on a whim.  But it holds you tightly beside your fellow Daemon, who even now you can only vaguely remember had been Isabella.  You both wriggle through the pleasure cycles.

You lost count of your orgasms somewhere in the twenties, and that had been hours ago when it had directed you to the bed.  Now you&#39;re utterly lost to the rapture, to its pleasure.  Sometimes you and Isabella are allowed to couple, grinding your smooth laminate cunts against each other, but not always.  Sometimes the male joins you.  Sometimes it just commands you to sit through the next orgasm.  You&#39;re not sure why.  It&#39;s not your concern.  (colour: purple)[It never should have been.]

Is the absence of ecstasy a feeling?  Already you cannot imagine it, but look upon it like a nightmare, horrific and unreal.  Only the shame remains, and that grows dimmer with each sensation that emanates from your tortured, rapturous cunt.  The thought of your womanhood sends your mind downward, playing across your encapsulated breasts, down along your strictly corseted waist, to the meeting of your thighs.  You cannot play with yourself even if you weren&#39;t bound, *They* have already claimed you, but the suit rewards your considered promiscuity nevertheless.  Pleasure atop pleasure.  

[[Writhing, moaning, you cum again.-&gt;Fail9]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2424" name="Fail9" tags="" position="3860,21956" size="100,100">Your last glimpse of Tysus Sargon is her standing over you as you lad upon your back.  The Daemon that had been Isabella straddles your head, pressing her cunt against your glossy mask, while below the male drives his obsidian shaft into your cunt.  All three of you are synced, cumming in glorious union, but it is Tysus who looks the most pleased.  She had won, after all.  And even came out further ahead than she had intended.  Nevertheless you barely notice her leaving, as you shift positions to rub your own mask against the male&#39;s member.  

Understanding had come to you slowly, but They had made it clear.  That lingering shame you wrestled with, at having lead yourself to this fate, it could be so easily done away with.  If you admitted to *yourself* you could not control what was happening to you, there would be no guilt.  Just pleasure.  Always pleasure.  You cum again, arching your back, feeling the suit sucking on your nipples, draining some liquid down your throat.  The details didn&#39;t matter, not when you could be cumming again.

But instead They ask you to rise, and you do.  Why wouldn&#39;t you?  The male awaits, perhaps he had been beside the bed this entire time.  Of Isabella there is no sign.  Had she already left?  Another thing that doesn&#39;t matter.  He presses his hand against your sealed cunt, claiming it.  But it was not him, it was Them.  Just as your hand against his bulge is not your own, its their will-- you just obey.  Together you submit, as you always will.  

You emerge out into daylight, the warmth of it upon your obsidian skin so very wonderful.  Where are you?  It doesn&#39;t matter.  What are you doing?  It doesn&#39;t matter.  

The crowds along the sidewalks part as you pass, their whispered words allowed to reach your ears.

What emerges is hard to identify as the scholarly Mistress Sargon.  The base of her outfit is now constituted by a black catsuit, but her every liberty is as restrained as your own.  From the pair of gags, ring and cock, seated in her mouth to the collar at her throat, from the bolero straitjacket holding her arms beneath her breasts to the way her hips shift with the obvious signs of plugs being installed, you recognize in that moment just how quickly Torei&#39;s laminate embrace could turn on a person.  Tysus has been installed within a slave suit, her own plotting have backfired spectacularly.

&quot;Oh, now *this* is a treat,&quot; Isabella breaths, her tone like laminate itself: smooth and alluring, but backed with all manner of sensual promises.  Tysus is clearly less amused, her eyes shooting your Mistress daggers, but her struggling is clearly achieving little.  In fact she almost topples herself, but Isabella is quickly to steady her, even as she gives you another glance.

&quot;I would suspect this particular outfit choice is her&#39;s, but reversing it upon her is quite inspired.  Very good, my slave.  Now...&quot; she turns, still guiding Tysus with hands upon her shoulders.  Talking as she walks, you follow dutifully.

&quot;Do not look so cross with me, Tysus,&quot; she all but purrs.  &quot;There is nothing more dangerous than the game our families play, after all, and I do think you underestimated my new pawn.&quot;

Crossing the antechamber back into the bedroom, she lines you up shoulder to shoulder with Tysus-- before forcibly pushing you both down upon the massive bed.

[[Your happy moan is matched with the Sargon&#39;s grunt of fear.-&gt;TaskPass3]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2433" name="TaskPass3" tags="" position="4309,20915" size="100,100">As Tysus impacts the slick sheets of the laminated bed beside you, the discomfort, concern, and most readily *fear* is evident in her expression.  To her cyclonic discontent you are quite calm however, having grown accustomed to Isabella&#39;s forceful nature, and the sensation of helplessness.  To most Torean slaves you would still be a novice in most things, of course, but compared to the fallen Mistress you&#39;re a veritable expert.  And you sense that difference will soon be made apparent as Isabella looks down on you both, a gloved finger held to her lips in thought.

&quot;Obviously we will *not* be utilizing the plan we discussed earlier.&quot;  Her crimson lips hold a smirk between each spoken word, although without her mirrored glasses she does seem a *bit* more approachable.  As approachable as a fully empowered Torean dominatrix could be.  Continuing, she moves back and forth, as if considering alternatives-- even though you know her well enough to recognize a decision has already been made.

&quot;I suspect you will not give me the passcode to your glass?&quot;  Isabella&#39;s question is met with an immediate shake of Tysus&#39; head, her anger having been stoked enough to rise to such a direct challenge.  Even so, your Mistress clearly had expected it.

&quot;As you will.  I am certain I will be able to convince you, Tysus.  I am *quite* experienced with getting what I want from someone in a uniform such as that.&quot; Her teeth are white, you almost imagine her fanged, a predator smiling over dinner.  Being on the menu somehow pleases you.  &quot;And it just so happens my new slave has performed admirably today.  Enough to earn a reward.  I do believe we will gag two slaves with a single ball, as the saying goes.  If... my slave is ready?&quot;

[[Moan eagerly!-&gt;Task4]]
[[Wriggle in your bondage.-&gt;Task4]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2434" name="Task4" tags="" position="4315,21068" size="100,100">&quot;Very good.&quot;  Halting her pacing, Isabella takes an imperious position standing above you both.  Her steel-tipped heels click resolutely upon the floor below.  &quot;The game we three will be playing is predicated on pleasure, but as a warning I will *not* allow either of you to cum without permission.&quot;

Even such a simple command clearly distresses Tysus, most probably at the prospect of confronting the *need* for such an order, but Isabella merely speaks over what her gag allows to escape.  &quot;I am well assured, my slave, that you know how to use your tongue when given a task.  I will presume the same of the rest of your body.  You will use Tysus for your pleasure, however you can manage.  I will observe, assist, and eventually take part... but you will take the lead for the moment.&quot;

You shift your laminated-covered head, only to meet Tysus already looking your way, the base of the cock lodged between her lips shifting minutely-- you imagine she&#39;s sucking on the shaft from the tension.  Her eyes speak to anxiety, and quite a bit of indignation at being used in such a manner.  Such concerns are pushed from your mind completely.  Your Mistress, the one who&#39;s pendent hung from your collar, had given you a command.

How will you follow it?

[[Wriggle closer to Tysus, try to press your gag to her&#39;s.-&gt;Task5Gag]]
[[Roll over and mount her, at the hips.-&gt;Task5]]
[[Roll over and mount her, at her head.-&gt;Task5Head]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2435" name="Task5Gag" tags="" position="4165,21217" size="100,100">Your straitjacket and corset do not allow much in upper body movement, but by squirming you manage to shift closer towards the equally bound Tysus.  She meets your coming with suspicion, your roll onto your side and shoulder with apprehension.  When you move to gaze into her eyes she shifts her own down, although that only has her staring at the black laminate that covered your breasts and arms.  

You counter by pressing your head forward, bringing the base of your gag against her own.  Again obsidian laminate meets its counterpart upon the Sargon, but while you provide a sensual gagged kiss she remains distant.  In a similar situation you would have given back immediately, surrendering to inhibition, but Tysus remains passive-- either unsure or unwilling.  Either way you recognize another tactic would be required.

[[Roll over, and mount her.-&gt;Task5]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2436" name="Task5" tags="" position="4315,21218" size="100,100">You adjust your positioning, sliding your knees, moving at a right angle to the Sargon laying upon her back.  As she looks up to you, wary and unwilling to engage, you come hip-to-hip with her.  From there your own instincts take over, the frustrating desire to utilize your plugged holes driving your pelvis forward and down, grinding gently against Tysus&#39; equally sealed cunt.  

The sensation that develops is immediate, and unbelievably *good.*  You&#39;ve debased yourself before, surrendering to inhibition, but never in a manner like this-- with another &#39;slave&#39; beneath you, her own glossy laminate sliding all but effortlessly against your own.  The material of your suits was designed for that, of course, being as slick to the touch of other laminate as anything else-- a mild protection against slaves pleasing themselves too easily.  And you would in fact have achieved little, were it not for the way the base of your plugs press against Tysus&#39;.

She clearly feels it too, her eyes widening, her head lifting from the bed as she tries to say something.  It emerges as little more than a moan however, one that you join in, looking down upon her with amusement.  That seems to anger her, but her body betrays her, and for the first time her own hips twitch-- reciprocating.

[[Set a slow pace.-&gt;Task6Slow]]
[[Set a quick pace.-&gt;Task6Fast]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2437" name="Task5Head" tags="" position="4465,21218" size="100,100">Rolling over, you twist your hips, using the momentum to land upon your knees.  Tysus remains below you, looking up with shock, before you eclipse her vision by sliding forward-- one knee each to her shoulders.  The position places the glossy laminate of your thighs and the meeting of your legs directly above her head, which you quickly take advantage of.  Lowering yourself you press your zippered cunt, forbidden to you by lock and key, against the equally smooth laminate of her mask.  The Sargon shifts, trying to turn away, but your thighs shepherd her-- forcing her to keep looking up.  

What she does not prove, however, is immediately helpful.  In a similar situation you may have pressed your head up, grinding your mouth and thus gag into the meeting of the thighs above, by Tysus remains passive-- either unsure or unwilling.  Either way, you work your hips back and forth, allowing the barest fire to be lit upon your fuse before realizing you will need to try another tactic.

[[Go Back.-&gt;Ending2]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2439" name="Slave CommitFAIL" tags="" position="516,8245" size="100,100">The seated Mistress peers up at you through mirrored glasses, her lips a sharp slant.  &quot;No, you&#39;re not.  As I said, I want you to think about it.  At the very least walk around a bit.  This is not a decision I want you rushing into lightly.&quot;

She gestures dismissively.  &quot;Clearly you need some practice following commands, anyway.&quot;

[[Suitably chagrined, you let the topic drop.-&gt;Isabella Hub]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2440" name="CourEnd5" tags="" position="2166,39746" size="100,100">Your suit spurs you on, through the packed streets of Grand Aekora.  Those walking about the street ignore you, other slaves passively, those without collars in a manner that forces you to step out of the way lest you be run over.  And your suit never strays far from the lash, spurring you on with sharp shocks and the occasional inspiration only Torean aphrodisiacs could provide.  Left, right-- faster, always faster.  

Passing from the financial district you enter a set of townhouses, the trendy abodes of those rich enough to own property this deep into downtown yet desiring something more than a penthouse.  That put them a bit from the hustle and bustle of downtown proper, but still within easy enough walking range-- although of course such persons would take carriages most often.  

Yet your destination finally does come into view, and stepping up to the heavy door you use the steel knocker.

[[Knock, knock, knock...-&gt;CourEnd6]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2441" name="CourEnd6" tags="" position="2166,39896" size="100,100">&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/eI7PaaO.jpg&quot; width=&quot;35%&quot; height=&quot;35%&quot;&gt;

(if: $CorSlave is true)[You have sunken deep into the heady cocktail of submission and desire your suit constantly edged you towards, but the woman who answers the door is a shock of reality that burns through the chemical rush.  She looks different, *very* different: her hair is blonde now, short cut and stylish, and her make is heavy and alluring, in the Torean manner.  But of course your eyes drift down to her uniform, a mixture of black and white laminate servant&#39;s livery.  The skirt is short, the corset tight, the laminate across her breasts taut enough to reveal pierced nipples.  Yet you recognize her nevertheless: *Corinth.*](else:)[You have sunken deep into the heady cocktail of submission and desire your suit constantly edged you towards, but the woman who answers the door is a shock reality that burns through the chemical rush-- or is perhaps exacerbated by it.

The skirt is short, the corset tight, the laminate across her breasts taut enough to reveal pierced nipples.  A fire burns between your legs her appearance only furthers.]

(if: $CorSlave is true)[Yet she doesn&#39;t recognize you.  How could she, beneath your layers of heavy laminate?  You are an anonymous slave, labeled only with your number: Courier #381.]  The soubrette, you recognize the traditional Torean role easily, peers at your mask intently.  (if: $CorSlave is true)[Perhaps she *did* recognize you?  No.  Corinth](else:)[The sourbrette] purses her lips, then speaks.

&quot;This is the Royallis estate,&quot; you are not given pleasantries or a proper greeting, given your status as a lowly slave, &quot;you have a delivery I presume?&quot;

[[Nod your head.-&gt;Cour7F]]
[[Begin the greeting protocol.-&gt;Cour7]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2442" name="Task6Slow" tags="" position="4240,21368" size="100,100">You take a slow pace, despite your own passions begging for more.  Somewhere deep down, below the laminate and bondage, beneath your own submissiveness you recognize that *you* have the greater experience here.  You can take it, in a way Tysus almost certainly cannot.

So you work your hips in languid, smooth strokes against the Sargon&#39;s own sealed womanhood.  She holds out for a bit, glaring up at you with distinct rage, but you perhaps more than any other know that Torei&#39;s particular delights have a tendency to seduce even the most resistant.  You&#39;re not sure where, reveling in the sensations as you are, but somewhere your fellow slave begins to try and force you to move quicker.  That you put down easily enough, seated atop her as you are it requires only leveraging your hips-- but it induces Tysus to change tactics, now matching your careful movements.  Cunt to cunt, plug to plug, you work against each other.  

[[Lean over, kiss her.-&gt;Task7Kiss]]
[[Lean over, press your breasts to hers.-&gt;Task7Breast]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2443" name="Task6Fast" tags="" position="4390,21368" size="100,100">You take a quick pace, giving in to your own passions begging for such a release.  Somewhere deep down, below the laminate and bondage, beneath your own submissiveness you recognize something else, however.  *You* have the greater experience here.  You can take it, in a way Tysus almost certainly cannot.

So you work your hips in bold, sharp strokes against the Sargon&#39;s own sealed womanhood.  She holds out for a bit, glaring up at you with distinct rage, but you perhaps more than any other know that Torei&#39;s particular delights have a tendency to seduce even the most resistant.  Your own desires grow, and so in turn do Tysus&#39;.  You&#39;re not sure where, reveling in the sensations as you are, but somewhere your fellow slave begins to try and match you.  Cunt to cunt, plug to plug, you work against each other.  

[[Lean over, kiss her.-&gt;Task7Kiss]]
[[Lean over, press your breasts to hers.-&gt;Task7Breast]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2444" name="Task7Kiss" tags="" position="4240,21519" size="100,100">Your straitjacket and corset make it difficult, requiring a distinct display of core strength, but carefully you lower yourself upon Tysus-- while keeping the pace you had established with her.  Waist to waist, breast to breast, you eventually settle down  upon her completely.  She squirms, trying to avert her eyes, but you hold her steady and continue forward, pressing your gagged mouth against her own.  More ebony laminate finds its counterpart on the noblewoman, coming with a bit of discomfort as the cock installed between your teeth shifts against your throat, but you endure-- if only to watch the far more obvious reaction Tysus has to her gag acting in a similar manner.  

Yet she does finally meet your eyes, even as your cunts continue to grind against each other, her lids falling into a half-veiled gaze that you recognize as... contentment.  Sexual frustration, yes, but also a distinct pleasure that is derived from your guidance and actions.  And that is exactly when your Mistress&#39; voice interrupts.  

&quot;Ass up, my slave,&quot; Isabella commands, her hand falling upon the lacing of your corset.  &quot;Present your cunt.&quot;

[[With a frustrated mewl, lift your hips and present yourself, as requested.-&gt;Task8Pass]]
[[You&#39;re close to climax, keep humping Tysus!-&gt;Task8Fail]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2445" name="Task7Breast" tags="" position="4390,21519" size="100,100">Leaning down, just a bit, shifts the effort of your hips.  The new angle forces your thrusting efforts to adjust, and Tysus struggles to follow, but she manages to again match your pacing after a gagged growl of annoyance.  She wanted your attentions, your plugged cunt, more than she would have ever readily admitted mere minutes ago.  

Yet you go even further, bringing your breasts down to meet Tysus&#39; own.  She&#39;s not pierced as you are, but her nubs are hardened from the sensuality you share, and she clearly fights to prevent herself from delighting in the teasing pleasure that is derived from the way you press your own against her.  

[[Lean down further, kiss her.-&gt;Task7Kiss]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2446" name="Task8Pass" tags="" position="4240,21685" size="100,100">You may be driven by your passions, quite literally a slave to them, but there is one thing that overrides such thoughts-- the will of your Mistress.  Her command, to lift your hips and present yourself, is clearly intended to separate your plugged nexus from Tysus&#39; own, thus denying you any chance for an easy climax.  But you obey, keeping your chest and lips pressed against the Sargon but lifting your rear, your spread legs presenting the gap between your thighs to the Mistress behind.

Tysus is less understanding, and tries to follow your hips, to continue the effort, but her position doesn&#39;t allow it.  When she recognizes just what she was doing it seems to shock her back into compliance as she drops her hips, turning her head to the side as she looks away.  You can imagine her cheeks burning red beneath the black laminate of her mask.  

&quot;Very good...&quot; Isabella meanwhile purrs from behind you, out of sight.  You cannot see her, but her touch follows shortly thereafter, her gloved hand almost electrifying in the way it makes you yearn for more.  She was a proper Torean Mistress after all, with years of experience and apparently a small harem of other slaves.  You cannot imagine how intimately skilled she could be at this.  

Whatever the case its certainly enough in that moment to induce a shiver down your back as she freely explores the gap between your thighs, a fingertip starting at your naval as she glides slowly across the smooth expanse, down between your legs proper and the hilt of the first plug entombed there.  Tysus is treated to the same experience, her squawked surprise making that obvious, but it is to you alone that Isabella continues.

&quot;You&#39;re a very good girl... mhm.  Are you a cock hungry fucktoy?&quot; The way she leaned into each subsequent word, as if driving them into your soul, is as teasing as her touch.

[[Moan readily, holding your pose.-&gt;Task9Pass]]

Her command, to lift your hips and present yourself, is clearly intended to separate your plugged nexus from Tysus&#39; own, thus denying you any chance for an easy climax.  So you persist, pressing into Tysus who eagerly follows suit-- although she does look away when she recognizes just what she was doing.  You can imagine her cheeks burning red beneath the black laminate of her mask.  

&quot;No,&quot; Isabella answers with a purr from behind you, out of sight.  You cannot see her, but her touch follows shortly thereafter, her gloved hand almost electrifying in the way it makes you yearn for more.  She was a proper Torean Mistress after all, with years of experience and apparently a small harem of other slaves.  You cannot imagine how intimately skilled she could be at this.  Yet in that moment she slides her hand between you and Tysus, forcing you apart and then slapping you sharply against the plug-- driving it into you, a sharp pain following as you snap instinctively into the position she had demanded.

Its enough in that moment to induce a shiver down your back as she then shifts to freely exploring the gap between your thighs, a fingertip starting at your naval as she glides slowly across the smooth expanse, down between your legs proper and the hilt of the first plug entombed there.  Tysus is treated to the same experience, her squawked surprise making that obvious, but it is to you alone that Isabella continues.

&quot;You will remember your place, or you *will* be punished further for it  Do you understand?  Of course you do.&quot;  She pauses for a second there, then leans in even closer.  &quot;Are you a cock hungry fucktoy?&quot; The way she spoke into each subsequent word, as if driving them into your soul, is as teasing as her touch.

But you do, for Isabella, even as a tremble slightly.  Your gagged answer, and your effort, are rewarded immediately by a grinding press of the plug sealed inside your cunt by your Mistress.  She even cups your womanhood directly, palm firmly between your legs, as satisfaction rings in her voice.

&quot;You&#39;re *my* fucktoy.  Remember that.  The only thing you should live for is pleasure.  Mine, and what I allow you to have of your own.  I&#39;m still deciding if I will allow you to cum during this...&quot;

You can hear the smirk in her voice, even as her hand retreats, and you&#39;re left to coldly hold position as Isabella&#39;s attention shifts to Tysus.  &quot;How about you?&quot;

The Sargon may have been momentarily swayed by your efforts, but to her rival she stiffens, huffing into her gag in an effort to ignore what you can only imagine is Isabella&#39;s hand upon her own slit.  Your Mistress is unperturbed.

&quot;We shall see, Tysus.  We shall see...&quot;  There is a snap, you suspect a slap against the other slave-suited woman&#39;s cunt, followed by Isabella standing from the bed again.  &quot;Reverse position, I want your cunt above her head.  Quickly now!&quot;

Your gagged answer, and your effort, are rewarded immediately by a grinding press of the plug sealed inside your cunt by your Mistress.  She even cups your womanhood directly, palm firmly between your legs, yet a warning rings in her voice.

&quot;You&#39;re *my* fucktoy.  Remember that.  The only thing you should live for is pleasure.  Mine, and what I allow you to have of your own.  You must learn to follow my instructions, I&#39;m still deciding if I will allow you to cum during this, and you&#39;re losing ground...&quot;

As you do so Isabella hooks the first of the chains she had retrieved to the cuff of the Sargon&#39;s right ankle, linking it to the corner post of the bed-- which helpfully featured a d-ring for just such purposes.  A second chain follows for her other leg, forcing them to spread, before she repeats the effort on you.  One chain each is hooked to your ankles as you straddle Tysus, although your leads are hooked to the opposite side of the bed.  

&quot;Ass up,&quot; Isabella then repeats, approaching you from behind.  Without seeking your consent, or indicating her intent, she pulls down the zipper that ran between your legs.  The hint of fresh air upon your nether lips is almost cruelly intense, yet the torture only increases as she seizes the first of the plugs and pulls it out.  With a wet squelch your cunt is freed, the retreat as tantalizing as the thought of the member thrusting, yet the wetness that sticks to the cock and runs down your leg only serves to induce Tysus&#39; ire-- some of it lands upon her mask.  Your rear plug comes out moments later, although Isabella twists it just a bit as if in mirth.

As you gasp at the sudden liberty Isabella continues, moving next to your mouth where her gloved fingers land upon the third cock buried there.  Slowly she pulls it free, grinning as she watches you try not to gag, even as your tongue chases the member-- it had grown so used to the presence.  Once the tip finally leaves your lips, she tosses it aside, then retreats.

Of course you achieve little beyond the sound of the heavy laminate of your straitjacket shifting, the restraints well considered in that moment.  So too do your legs try to come together, to perhaps allow the laminate of your thigh to press against your exposed womanhood, but the chains quickly go taut and you can only moan-- a sound that does emerge much louder without a cock between your lips.

&quot;Patience,&quot; Isabella commands, as she works to shift Tysus into much the same situation.  Her gag is removed as well, although Isabella only withdraws her vaginal plug, allowing the rear insert to remain.  Even so, you cannot help but stare down at the pale flesh between her obsidian-coated legs.  Only your Mistress&#39; further touch breaks its hold upon you, as she runs a final chain from your collar down between your breasts, where she links it with Tysus&#39;.

&quot;We are going to play a little game,&quot; she then explains, returning to the nightstand to search out something else.  &quot;A simple one, but good training for my slave... and perhaps instructive for a Sargon too, hm?  The rules are simple.  First one to cum *loses.*&quot;

She pulls forth a riding crop, the short rod tipped with a rectangular bit of hardened laminate.  You bite down upon your ring gag before even realizing it, thinking of its sting.  Isabella however simply continues.  &quot;As you&#39;ve undoubtedly noticed, your chains prevent you from moving off each other-- and your position, head to cunt, allows access to each other&#39;s slits.  I will not be removing your ring gags, slaves have little to say of importance, but your tongue is still readily available is it not?&quot;

She pulls from the draw a long, glossy member.  Another cock, but this one affixed to a series of straps she begins placing around her hips.  It takes you a moment, but once the phallus is hanging lewdly from her hips you recognize it for what it is: a strap-on.  Just in time too, as Isabella smiles.

&quot;...I will be working her ass.  Which, I do suspect, she will rather *enjoy.*&quot;  Ratcheting the last of the straps in place, Isabella crosses to the bed, kneeling upon the bed behind you.  Pressing her hips forward, she runs the cock lewdly between your legs-- teasing-- before positioning it near you rear.  &quot;Are the rules clear, girls?&quot;

Tysus moans in resignation.  &quot;Good.  Now let&#39;s put those tongues to work!&quot;

She in turn thrusts her own into yours, a returned favor that comes as you pull fruitlessly against your straitjacket and restraints-- trying to close your legs, to further the pleasure more than to protect yourself at this point.  But its all in vain, or proceeds exactly as intended depending on your state of mind.  Either way, you and Tysus cum together.

The peak of the mountain that is your climax is as cool and rewarding as you could have ever dreamed, the waves of adoring pleasure furthered by the cock Isabella still plunges into your rear.  Quivering, moaning like a slut in heat, you eventually crest the finally hill and begin the long slide down into the afterglow.

The peak of her climax had been reached, and you gleefully push her over, the fallen Mistress moaning in mindless ecstasy as she cums wildly.  

Yet in a last desperate throw of the dice she tries to return the favor, pressing her gagged lips against your cunt, seeking your clit with her tongue.  Finding it, she works as hard and as quickly as she can, trying to drag you off that cliff into the abyss of rapture with her.

You cum, hard-- and yet in that moment recognize a last chance, if not for a win, then a tie-- if you move quickly you could find Tysus&#39; clit, stimulate her with every ounce of coherent thought still possible within your sex crazed brain...

Your ring gag makes it difficult but you persist, pressing hard, sucking upon the flesh all around as you seek with your tongue-- and with a rolling flourish find it!

The effect is immediate, and just as you desired.  Tysus head rolls back as quickly as her eyes, her back arching despite her corset, limbs straining against the straitjacket and chains that held them.  You hold on for the ride, working your tongue until it aches, driving her like a skittish creatures towards the warmth and safety of a barn.

The peak of the mountain that is your climax is as cool and rewarding as you could have ever dreamed, the waves of adoring pleasure furthered by the cock Isabella still plunges into your rear. Quivering, moaning like a slut in heat, you eventually crest the final hill and begin the long slide down into the afterglow.

Clearly she had not expected your last desperate gamble.  Quickly your strength fades however, the ecstasy of your orgasm overtaking you and you retreat-- your effort in vain.

There is a sense of triumph from Tysus as you cum alone, lost to the whims of your own body as you moan lewdly, drool running down your chin to land upon your chest.  The peak of the mountain that is your climax is as cool and rewarding as you could have ever dreamed, the waves of adoring pleasure furthered by the cock Isabella still plunges into your rear.

The scent of her cunt near your face entices you, just as you imagine she is experiencing much the same below.

&quot;A loss for my property,&quot; Isabella finally speaks, still imperious as always, but with a soothing turn-- as if caressing you with each word, helping you down from the high of the game you had just played.  Her hand upon the small of your back, where the lacing of your corset remained taut like the strings of an instrument, is gentle as she continues.  &quot;Hmm... how interesting.(if: $Strike2 is 3)[  Although perhaps unsurprising, given my slave so willingly took the handicap of a full load during the experience.]  I suppose this means I will have to punish my slave, but that will wait for the moment.  Tysus, dear, are you done cumming?&quot;

Beneath you Tysus stirs, although she&#39;s too exhausted to achieve anything more than a groan.  Even so the sound is filled with weariness, a feeling you share from cunt to tongue-- the latter especially well worked.  Nevertheless Isabella remains focused, even as she begins undoing your chains.

&quot;Perhaps you should have retained your dignity, Sargon.  One cannot expect much from a slave, but a Torean woman of *your* standing working so *eagerly* to please a mere slave?  I suspect you&#39;re ashamed.&quot;  No reply comes, although as Isabella helps you off of the other slave-suited women you see her pointedly looking away.  Its a reaction that Isabella accepts in stride.

&quot;It would be so easy to spread this among our shared social circles, wouldn&#39;t it?  Oh, the *scandal...*&quot;

[[That you had done the same is, of course, of no consequence.-&gt;Scandal]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2470" name="Scandal" tags="" position="4091,23042" size="100,100">*That* clearly catches Tysus&#39; attention, an angry squawk emerging from her gag as she sits up-- now that your chains have been removed and you have rolled off her, she at least manages that.  At meeting Isabella&#39;s eyes however, when she is so *right*, proves to be far more difficult.  The Sargon is left to growl, although even that cuts off when she realizes her zipper is still down, and instead pulls her legs hastily together.

&quot;I thought the same,&quot; Isabella continues, with a clear smirk upon her crimson lips.  &quot;So I am willing to make a deal with you, a very simple one.  Not like the backhanded lies that got you into this situation, hm?  I want the access codes for your glass device, so that I may send the request for my slave to be negotiated out of the AI&#39;s attention on her behalf.  That&#39;s it, and I will tell not a soul of what has occurred here.&quot;

Crossing from the bed to the nightstand where Tysus&#39; purse had been deposited, Isabella&#39;s strap-on remains strictly at attention, the tip dripping with lubricant.  Pulling forth the glass in question, she looks to Tysus.  

&quot;Deal?&quot;

A long moment passes, but in the end she nods.  &quot;Wonderful,&quot; Isabella enthuses, returning to the bed to begin removing her ring gag.  &quot;Now tell me what I want to know...&quot;

[[Who can say no to your Mistress?  Certainly not you.-&gt;Scandal2]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2471" name="Scandal2" tags="" position="4090,23192" size="100,100">With her gag removed Tysus is quiet, subdued from her experience.  But she does talk.  Giving over the passcode, she then directs Isabella through the quick process of lodging a request with the Sargon bureaucracy.  There still remained the matter of actually rejecting the Daemon&#39;s offer, of course, but your Mistress had achieved a considerable step for your benefit.  And Tysus promptly tries to ruin it.

&quot;Now you need to let me out of this gear so that I--&quot; its all she manages before Isabella is back at her with the ring gag, followed shortly thereafter with the cock insert-- that Tysus growls against, her tongue being forced down by the phallic intruder as Isabella shoves it into place with a secure *click.*  Her inserts are returned as well, the zipper between her legs slid back up despite the gagged complaints the Sargon gives, and that Isabella promptly ignores.  Then your Mistress turns on you.

Isabella Naram-Sin was not a woman to allow a slave much freedom, and even in the aftermath of her little game she sets quickly to restoring you to total impotence and submission.  Your oral insert is first, the phallic gag being slid into your defenseless mouth with ease.  Unlike Tysus, you do not resist it.

With all three holes filled again you feel... perversely whole, as if such casual violation was your truly natural state.  Isabella meanwhile stands at the foot of the bed, looking at you and Tysus.  &quot;Time for prizes and punishments, girls.&quot;

They don&#39;t go far, only to the foot of it, where she aligns the Sargon with her back to the heavy canopy pole, one of which is at each corner of the bed.  There she produces a series of heavy laminate straps, using them to affix her to the pole standing straight up-- a binding at calf, waist, and across her arms ensuring she could not move away.  To that she adds a blindfold, the black laminate blending seamlessly with her mask as it is hooked to the mag-points you both sported at the temples.

The final component, and the true punishment, is the wand Isabella withdraws from the nearby wardrobe.  Bulbous and a bit soft at one end, a simple flick of the switch sends it to vibrating greedily-- a revelation Tysus is greeted to when it is slid up between her legs.  A final strap holds it in place there, her own thighs assisting, with the top pressed firmly up against her cunt, and thus the insert featured there.

She looks so helpless there, bound, gagged, and twisting in her restraints as the vibe wand purrs mercilessly.  What had once been Tysus Sargon is little more than a laminate slave now, covered from toe to head in black, a collar firmly around her neck.  She had been rendered impotent, an object of mere desire and sensuality.  One you imagine will get no release from that vibrator, given how recently she had cummed.  Only torturous frustration.  

And Isabella&#39;s riding crop, which is applied with a sharp crack along Tysus&#39; tits.  She screams in response, but the gag muffles it, and your Mistress ignores it utterly.  Instead she turns to you.  (if: $Strike2 is 3)[&quot;You&#39;ve impressed me, I want you to know that.  Taking the full load of my cock up your rear and *still* winning the game?  How... wonderful.

Another casual strike of the crop is made upon Tysus, this time her flank, but afterward Isabella comes towards you.  Taking a seat on the bed, she beckons for your kneeled approach and attendance.  With one arm she wraps it around your shoulders, reaching up to pet you on the laminated head-- as if you were a pet.  &quot;I will see Tysus through her punishment, it will take a few hours.  You will be allowed to rest, as much as you can in that uniform, but before you do there is the matter of your reward.&quot;

It entices, drawing you towards greater pleasure, but never suggests a push towards climax-- you&#39;ve came too recently for that.  It is not the only portion of your punishment however, a fact revealed by the sudden crack just below your chin, the sound registering before pain that emerges from your right breast.  Isabella&#39;s riding crop!

A second strike follows moments later, this time on your flank, before a hand roughly seizes your chin.  Blinded and gagged, you can do little but listen as Isabella shifts your head to whisper into your ear.  &quot;As a slave I expect you to be a slut, that is what you&#39;re best at.

Sister&#39;s Raiments: *a physical manifestation of your Vow of Obedience, this set of cuffs at your wrists and ankles are referred to as a Sister&#39;s Raiments, often in conjunction with her collar.  Built of simple heavy laminate, they feature an included d-ring and inlaid mag-locks for anything from simple restraint to far more complex bondage.  You do not have the key to remove them.*</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2487" name="Nun6" tags="" position="2080,16357" size="100,100">&quot;Allow me to formally introduce my Sister, then,&quot; Euphoria continues, a hand upon your back pushing you forward a step.  Moving closer to the Master only emphasizes his masculinity, the muscles of his chest and arms evident beneath the laminate that covers him.  Your vow of femininity had been an admission of your own weakness, and that of your gender in general, but Petros is an exemplar of the opposite: the male form, almost certainly refined by Torean biomedical technology towards a perfection so far removed from your smooth curves and full hips.  Euphoria would have probably prompted consideration of that duality, had she not been introducing you.

&quot;I, Sister Euphoria, present to you Sister Azalea of the Order of the Primrose, five-vowed Novice and treasured slave of the Benefactor.  Provided for your pleasure, and at your service.&quot;  

The words are formalized, a ritual greeting that Petros takes in stride.  Stepping forward himself, he reaches out without hesitation, seizing your chin.  Black laminate meets white as he shifts your head to one side, then the other, his examination progressing downward in quick fashion.  

&quot;Shoulders back,&quot; he commands, already turning you so he stands at your side.  &quot;Press out your chest.&quot;

[[Comply immediately.-&gt;Nun6A]]

Your uniform already enforced a strict posture, but forcing your own shoulders back heightens the effect.  Your back curves, pressing your laminate encapsulated breasts out further, and making your hardened nipples all the more obvious through such tight material.  Further down your rear is emphasized as well, a fact Petros notes immediately, his free hand coasting down a smooth cheek.  Afterward he seizes a breast, watching your eyes for a reaction before stepping away as suddenly as he had begun.

&quot;Offworlder,&quot; is his conclusion, with a slight hint of disdain in his voice.  Had that been your own tie to Torei you get the feeling he would be far more hostile, but everything that follows sees him retreat back towards stern neutrality.  &quot;Unimproved, but well proportioned regardless.  A few weeks of exercise and a diet change of slave feed will do wonders regardless, although I am sure that is your intent Sister Euphoria.  Very good.&quot;

He slaps your rear once, as if you were a young filly who had passed inspection.  Euphoria meanwhile speaks up.

&quot;I was quite pleased to collar her as well, Master.  And please, allow me to thank you for providing escort at such short notice.&quot;

&quot;Serendipity,&quot; he grunts, reaching to his wait-- upon which you notice several black devices hanging, which you had not noticed before.  Caught in the gleam of light upon his laminate, you catch sight of a veritable belt-load of restraints.  &quot;I had intended to spend the evening at Club Lush already.  Do you intend to provide oblations?&quot;

Nevertheless you manage, although your Sister only raises her brows in response-- a subtle indication to do exactly as the Master commanded.  So you do.

Petros meanwhile reaches up, snapping a leash much like your own to her collar.  The elder sister had lifted her chin to make it easier, and continues now without comment-- beyond passing him your leash as well.  &quot;Our primary purpose is to settle Sister Azalea&#39;s accounts, though, as they are.  She came to the bosom of our Order in a manner of distress.&quot;

Petros nods, his gasmask revealing no hint of what he thought about such things.  You have only his words, and they remain focused solely upon the service he was providing.  &quot;You will provide satisfaction at the Club itself,&quot; he commands, &quot;for my assistance.  Initiate your bindings.&quot;

Euphoria reaches over, taking one wrist each of your&#39;s in her hands.  Pressing her thumb to the portion of your raiment locked upon your wrists, she then guides them behind your back-- where they snap readily together, drawn together as if welded by the heavy magnets your Sister had engaged.  Thus secured, she then thumbs her own cuffs before taking the same position, her wrists linking together behind her back.  

Petros pulls further devices from his belt, but then looks to you.  &quot;Legs together.  Cock or ball?&quot;

He&#39;s greeted with your stenciled lips, the words **Sinner** and **Slave**-- firm reminders of your status, both within the Order and upon Torei generally.  It gives him no pause however, as his gloved hands press a black laminate *thing* between them.  A cock-shaped gag, your curious tongue confirms as its rigid length slides in further and further, forcing you to suckle on it.

Your mask already featured buckle points at cheek and temple for gags and blindfolds respectively, and he makes use of them now, affixing your new gag with ease.  Afterward he pulls back up your muzzle, all but hiding your gag without reducing its effectiveness.

Euphoria, for her part, only watches with a radiant gaze red-hot with glee.  &quot;As women, our speech should be treated as a privilege, Sister.  The burden of such liberties Master Petros is kind to remove from us.&quot;

Only moments later, she is being subjected to the same treatment.  The way the taller woman leans forward, eagerly sucking the cock down between her lips, you have to imagine she believed every word she had said.

Petros&#39; Ball: *a laminate ball gag, of the trainer style to ensure you cannot remove it easily.  Seated behind your teeth it forces your lips apart, and reduces any sound you attempt to a moaned mmmmmgh!

The corrective shock is expected, but it nevertheless hurts, your legs quivering slightly as the soubrette notes your distress with a raised brow.

&quot;You must be new?  Usually your kind... ah, there it is.&quot;

You&#39;re already moving, kneeling before your fellow slave, demonstrating your lower position in the complex hierarchy of the collared.  Governesses and personal servants to nobility ranked amongst the highest, followed by those like (if: $CorSlave is true)[Corinth](else:)[the soubrette before you] who had been trained for specialty positions of prestige.

On your knees you spread your legs, a demonstration of submission as much as it is a greeting.  Reaching to your pack, you deftly unhook the leash hanging from one side, and snap the metallic end to the ring provided at the front of your collar for just such use.  The thick laminate loop is than offered upward, to the soubrette-- a silent proposition and request, to be taken to her own.  She takes it immediately, a bright smile appearing on her ruby red lips.

Its small, although you quickly determine that was due to location more than the Mistress&#39; wealth-- land near Grand Aekora was becoming quite expensive indeed, but the decor you pass through is sumptuous to the extreme.  Gleaming fixtures, a wooden (perhaps even real instead of imitation?) grand staircase, at least two glittering chandeliers... but of course the truth wealth is not in any inanimate object but the *slaves*.  You pass a few, another soubrette tidying up a library, a serving girl of some sort glimpsed in the kitchen.  Only one halts your passage completely however, by crawling into the doorway ahead.

Only her eyes are visible from a uniform that otherwise covers her completely in laminate, heavy bondage keeping her on hands and knees.  Likewise a thick gag prevents speech, and bondage mitts render her hands into little more than useless paws-- a theme that fits her mask, as laminate ears stick up in facsimile of a pet.  A catgirl.

&quot;Cici,&quot; (if: $CorSlave is true)[Corinth](else:)[your guide] chides, kneeling before the catgirl.  &quot;You cannot have *all* my attention.  If you don&#39;t move Mistress will...&quot; (if: $CorSlave is true)[

Corinth halts, looking back at you for a moment, then smiles again.  Reaching out she pets the catgirl, who purrs happily, and in the same move draws you in closer with a sudden pull on your leash.

&quot;We only have a few moments.  I can blame this pause on Cici, she&#39;s new.  You&#39;re... do you know me?&quot;  She glances back your way, eyes narrowing as she searches your mask-- as if capable of looking through it.  &quot;Is it... *you* in there?&quot;

The soubrette sighs, and then reaches to her belt.  Apparently she had little time to explain to the catgirl, if such a creature would even make the effort to understand, and instead merely deploys a small controller against her.  The girl leaps in surprise, shaking her head in a way you can easily relate to-- her collar must have shock functionality.  It certainly incentivizes her to back away, although not without a huffed exhalation delivered towards your guide.  The soubrette shrugs, stands, and continues on.  &quot;She&#39;s a new slave.&quot;

[[And you follow towards the door across the room.-&gt;Cour9]]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2499" name="CorBreakF" tags="" position="1776,40346" size="100,100">Your suit intervenes, too well programmed to miss *that* attempt at communication.  That you were not allowed such a simple freedom is reinforced by a warning on your HUD, followed by the expected shock along your implants.  No matter how much you steel yourself, the pain still leaves you quaking for a few moments.  

Corinth however notes your distress.  &quot;Was that... if its you, try... something else?&quot;

[[Thrust out your hips.-&gt;CorBreakT]]

But it only served the company for its slaves to lack dignity, to wear their desires on their proverbial laminate sleeves-- and thus it allows you to freely press your hips forward as you spread your legs, presenting yourself to your friend.

Corinth picks up on it immediately, the heavy eyeshadow she wore emphasizing the way her eyes widen.  &quot;I *knew* it,&quot; she enthuses, albeit at a conspiratorial whisper.  &quot;I heard you went into the lower tier programs of course, so I always thought... but then it was like the way you walked or something, I don&#39;t know I...&quot;

She tips her head, still petting the catgirl to cover her ruse.  &quot;...I&#39;m not sure what I can say.  We&#39;ve... come a long way, haven&#39;t we?&quot;  Between her maid livery, and your fully encapsulated suit, you certainly are not the pair of naive offworlders you may once have been.  The tight collars around each your throats ensured that.  

&quot;I really wish... you would have applied yourself more, at the Academy,&quot; Corinth finally seems to conclude.  &quot;Maybe you could have been here, with me... or even been made into what Cici is.&quot;  She looks to the strictly bound catgirl, and you recognize in her expression a truthfulness to her words-- Corinth really did believe you would be better off like *that*, without a shred of dignity, crawling around like a pet.  

&quot;You can&#39;t talk, I know...&quot; she continues, &quot;and I&#39;m not sure there is much to say... but I can at least help you, a bit.  You&#39;ll see, once you make your delivery.  Which you need to do, Mistress will be waiting for my report at who was at the door.  Come on.&quot;

Together you enter into the sanctum of the estate, the office of its owner Mistress Royallis.  She&#39;s seated behind a large desk, again at least appearing to be of the rare wooden variety.  Her attire is laminate, as was to be expected of minor Torean nobility, the layered material and gloves matching the expected conduct of one so stationed-- you&#39;ve come to learn as a courier that handling business documents with bare hands was considered in quite poor taste by traditionalists.  The effort to adhere to cultural expectations is continued by your guide, the soubrette bowing sharply at the waist, lifting her skirts to reveal her panties beneath in a clean reverence.

[[Perform a reverence as well.-&gt;Cour10]]

Was it really *you* under all the laminate, anymore?  You don&#39;t think so.  The woman Corinth had known had been forced to her knees more times than you can count, made to beg and serve and please.  Her dignity had been stripped away, followed by her identity once you were locked inside your suit.  You are just a numbered slave now, one of dozens serving your firm, thousands living in Grand Aekora, of the millions across Torei.  

You remain still, and the soubrette eventually frowns.  &quot;I thought... never mind, I suppose.  At least you cannot tell my Mistress that I asked, like that.&quot;

She stands abruptly, and then reaches to her belt.  Apparently she had little time to explain to the catgirl, if such a creature would even make the effort to understand, and instead merely deploys a small controller against her.  The girl leaps in surprise, shaking her head in a way you can easily relate to-- her collar must have shock functionality.  It certainly incentivizes her to back away, although not without a huffed exhalation delivered towards your guide.  Corinth shrugs, then tugs your leash.

&quot;Come on, the Mistress awaits.

Lacking a skirt you instead flair out your arms, then hold.  Together you stay there, waiting for release that comes *eventually.*  Mistress Royallis clearly made full use of her prerogative to let you wait.  Even so, from your bent over posture you can see her put down her pen to look upon you directly-- some didn&#39;t even bother with that.  

&quot;A full protocol courier,&quot; she notes.  &quot;You must have the Master&#39;s documents I&#39;ve been waiting for.  Excellent.  You may proceed.&quot;

It was too late now though, not without making it awkward, and the Mistress pushes on.

&quot;A full protocol courier,&quot; she notes.  &quot;You must have the Master&#39;s documents I&#39;ve been waiting for.  Excellent.  You may proceed.&quot;

Striding forward, placing each step before the other to maximize the sway of your hips, you approach the desk.  Once standing before it you lean forward until your breasts rest against the surface, a full bow that you further by sharply snapping your legs apart.  

The posture prevented you from doing much of anything else, but of course that was the point.  You could not have opened your backpack had you wanted to, the different openings were locked with digital keys your recipients were sent beforehand-- ensuring only they could take final delivery.  To do just that Royallis stands, circling her desk to approach you from behind.  (if: $Strike is 1 or 2)[You&#39;re surprised to feel her hand slide between your legs momentarily, teasing more than anything else, but inducing a gagged moan from you nevertheless-- undoubtedly a wordless approval of your presentation.]

Bent over the desk, legs splayed, a beautiful woman in laminate behind you, you try to focus on literally anything else.  The hours of teasing and occasional aphrodisiacs of course prevent that, leaving you wet, horny, and decidedly unfulfilled-- but that was part of the service you provided too.  What fun would there be in unaroused slaves?

You feel the clasp of your pack close before Royallis steps away, returning to view before you with several sheets of thin-lam held in her hands.  Taking a seat, you lose her interest, an errant wave of the hand dismissing you.  But not before a final command is given to (if: $CorSlave is true)[Corinth.](else:)[the attending soubrette.]

(if: $CorSlave is true)[Corinth](else:)[The Soubrette] sighs, producing a small glass device from her belt.  You recognize her syncing with your courier service&#39;s external site, registering your delivery-- as well as deciding on if you deserved a tip or not.  Quite obviously, she had been instructed to deny you that.

(if: $CorSlave is true)[&quot;I hate to do this,&quot; Corinth notes, holding a finger over the confirmation button.  &quot;I know what they do to your kind when given poor feedback... but I think its important you undergo it, you know?

She doesn&#39;t wait for an answer, knowing you could not give it-- and instead presses the blinking button on her glass.  It takes a moment for the data to transmit to your owner&#39;s, then for the proper orders to reach your suit.  Torean informational technology remained incredibly dated by galactic standards.

So you kneel quickly, spreading your legs and straightening your back-- thrusting your chest out without worrying about the way it so prominently portrayed your breasts.  Anything less and you would be punished further.  Your hands meanwhile you move behind your back, crossing them at your wrists.  Flattening your palms, you hold them each outward facing, another facet the suit watched carefully.

Immediately your suit moves into action.  Stimulators awake between your legs and around your nipples, the latter already perpetually hard but addressed nevertheless.  Quickly they push you towards climax, only to immediately induce heavy shocks when you even *thought* you were approaching that pleasurable peak.  The pain is as intensive as the pleasure, and quickly sets a torturous rhythm you have no hope of escaping.  You&#39;re edged, without mercy or release, only to be denied-- again, and again, and again...

All the while your suit monitors your posture, watching for the slightest deviation.  Were you to close your legs just a bit, or lower your gaze, or ball your hands into fists-- it would know, and thus would come shocks until you returned to compliance.  The result is a full body workout as you stiffly try to remain utterly still, even as your holes and points of sensuality are worked so roughly.  A small progress bar on your HUD notes how far you were through the lesson, but outward your suit projects a different message.

The man who could only be your new owner is only a few years older than yourself.  That surprised many that met with him, but Master Tenyon had built his empire upon embracing the unexpected.  A self-made man born on a backwater in the Vawking Cluster, he had come to Torei upon reaching adulthood.  You&#39;ve never heard *why* exactly, but his embrace of Torei&#39;s culture-- and the unique opportunity it provided for a man with ambition-- had been immediate.  

Tenyon Imports had been built upon the untapped market deeper within Torei for offworlder goods, which still struggle to disperse far beyond the Way Up itself.  The more antipodal Ringdoms being deeply conservative remained part of the problem, but so too had been a lack of interest from the offworlders themselves.  Torei remained such a fresh frontier, at least when it came to trading, and there was wealth enough for most where it was easy to travel.

But Master Tenyon had taken risks early, building contacts far from the usual centers of trade.  Today his goods flowed steadily into the heart of the planet, even if it remained somewhat of a trickle compared to the glut that rained down upon the Mountainous Ringdoms.  Still, that success had brought him immense wealth, enough to own hundreds of slaves-- including yourself.

The wonders of Torei still surround you, just as they had that morning when you first stepped out from the hotel to gaze in wonder at Grand Aekora&#39;s streets.  But now things are almost reversed.  While then you had been just another wide-eyed tourist, now *you&#39;re* the collared and restrained slavegirl that offworlders-- almost always so obvious in the way they stared-- gawked at openly.  Certainly you struck quite an image, in your laminate regalia, side-by side with your red uniformed, taller Sister, following along on the leash the male before you held tightly.

You draw even further attention when Petros leads you out into the night on occasion, taking shortcuts between the covered walkways that allowed freewombs to skirt curfew at this hour-- chained to a proper Torean Master, you&#39;re in a spotlight all your own out there, the throngs visible through the windows peering out with understandable curiosity.  Even among Toreans, your uniform is particularly strange.

Passing back into another covered area, you approach not the Club that was your destination, but a small shop of some sort.

[[Just what was Petros doing?-&gt;Nun11]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2522" name="Nun11" tags="" position="2008,17299" size="100,100">At the door of the shop Petros continues a few steps onward, to a series of simple metal poles driven into the ground.  You&#39;ve passed a few such sets during your walk, none more than half a dozen in number, but only now do you realized their use as you observe one already &#39;occupied.&#39;  A slave, her full enclosure suit marking her as clearly as the collar around her throat, is kneeling with her back to the pole, arms wrapped around it.  A chain between her wrists is linked to a second one between her ankles, keeping her stationary, while another link between the back of her collar and the pole ensures she could not move.  A set of public hitching posts, much like the one you had been hooked to in the terminal.

&quot;I must make a call to my estate,&quot; Petros explains.  &quot;And the Club is loud.  I will use one of the stations inside, but slaves are not allowed into terminal cafes.  You will await my return.&quot;

He does not give you an option to refuse, although given your restraints you doubt you could manage much anyway.  Euphoria takes it in stride anyway, her habit shifting as she nods.  She&#39;s the first to led to a pole, and in her bondage you realize Petros would be leaving you in a harsher state than even the slave-suited woman.

Euphoria is placed with her back to the pole, bound arms lifted over it so as to encircle before she lowers down into a kneel.  The first chain Petros produces is attached to the back of her collar, linking it with a hardpoint at the top of the pole-- just as the slave girl was restrained.  He goes further however by then forcing her booted feet up, further and further until they press against the backs of her thighs.  There he links them, keeping them in place, allowing Euphoria only her knees themselves upon which to balance.  She wriggles afterward, her full breasts shifting lewdly atop her corset, but can neither take her weight from her knees nor fall over-- a position you quickly recognize as agonizing.  Even so, your elder Sister seems to be smiling around her gag, beneath her muzzle.

[[And you&#39;re next.-&gt;Nun12]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2523" name="Nun12" tags="" position="2008,17449" size="100,100">The process is repeated upon your slighter form.  Back to the pole, leashed, arms around it, legs forced up and behind your thighs.  In mere moments you&#39;re kneeling in pain, back curved and breasts pushed out as you wriggle just as intently as Euphoria, fighting in vain for a position that would give you comfort.  Upon the harsh concrete your knees complain of taking your whole weight, and the way your arms are wrenched back and secured around the pole induce a burning in your shoulders.  A final addition comes in the way Petros tightens the straps of your corset that ran between your legs, squeezing another half inch from them, the grinding sensation of the thick laminate running to each side of your womanhood damnably close to providing a teasing sensation.

You moan in response but Petros ignores you, instead standing.  He had explained himself once and makes no effort to do so again, but merely turns towards the terminal cafe.  The door clicking closed is the final announcement of his dismissal, while you are left behind on a public street, bound and gagged.  At your side Euphoria arches her back just a bit further, fully presenting herself, while the slave bound to your other side merely stares warily.

[[Present yourself eagerly, as your Sister demonstrates.-&gt;Nun13Present]]

Head lifted to demonstrate your veiled nature, back curved alluringly, emphasizing bust and rear, and of course legs spread willingly.  All of it forces you against your restraints, but not in a manner that sought escape-- just the opposite in fact.  The added discomfort is merely a byproduct of your submission, seeking out every facet of liberty left to you so as to better recognize that you are well and truly bound.

And it is not long before you draw attention. The slave-suited woman to your side had been there longer, but her sort were common enough-- several pass by, a few leashed, others undoubtedly running errands for their owners.  But your uniform is unique, excepting Euphoria&#39;s at your side of course, and its ritual complexity quickly draws interest.  The first is a woman in a blue office slave&#39;s attire, although the lack of a collar announces she was a freewomb, her short skirt requiring her to crouch down carefully before Euphoria as she stops.  

&quot;Sister,&quot; she greets, the uniformity of Euphoria&#39;s rank preventing any identification beyond that.  &quot;Your Order is always such an inspiration to me...&quot;

You struggle, as millions of Toreans have done before.  And like so many others, you do so in vain.  Laminate, Torei&#39;s most useful material, is as resilient as it is unyielding.

At your chest her fingers merely dance, fingertips running along your encapsulated breasts, her eyes wide with excitement.  

&quot;I can&#39;t... imagine what its like, to wear all this.&quot;  Her exploring continues, a mark of her acclimation to Torean culture that she hardly considers your violation.  &quot;To submit entirely to the strictures of the Order.  I... think about it, sometimes.  I know that I&#39;m weak, as a woman, just like your scriptures say.  That it would just be *natural* to submit, like you have.  You&#39;re so brave!&quot;

She bites her lip, then pulls her hands away.  They collect before her, wringing a bit.  Anxious.  &quot;Are you regretting your choice to submit to the Order?  At all?&quot;

Or perhaps disappointment.  Your inability to elaborate provides the room she needed for her faith however, and she fills it it appropriately.  Clearly she *had* spent some considerable time in the Convent.

&quot;Its natural to have doubts.  Obviously its too late for you, though.  And I&#39;m sure the Sisters will train you out of it.&quot;  She glances to Euphoria, who is watching the exchange without any indication of her own thoughts.  The freewomb sighs.  &quot;Maybe a couple more sessions will help me make a decision.  Until then, more *work.*&quot;

She stands, adjusts her skirt, and walks away.

[[Clearly the daily grind could prove bothersome, even on Torei.-&gt;Nun16]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2530" name="Nun15B" tags="" position="2104,17961" size="100,100">Your response seems to catch the woman by surprise, even if she had just moments before been expressing interest in your commitment.  &quot;Really?  Just looking at you... do you *like* being kept like that?&quot;  

She doesn&#39;t get an answer, given your inability to speak.  But she does glance to Euphoria, who is watching the exchange from her own hitching post beside you.  &quot;You know... maybe I should go and talk with the Sisters at the Convent, one more time... to wear a uniform like yours...&quot;

She stands, adjusts her skirt, then looks down at you again.  A shiver, a smile, and walks away.

[[Another convert?  Only time would tell.-&gt;Nun16]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2531" name="Nun16" tags="" position="2027,18120" size="100,100">The woman disappears into the crowd, and proves to be bolder than most.  Others pause to stare at you and Euphoria, and occasionally the third girl wearing a slave suit, but none approach you.  What had been a novel experience starts to grow stale, especially as your body begins to protest at the strict bondage, yet your escort and temporary Master still doesn&#39;t emerge.  

You find yourself growing increasingly aroused, despite your best efforts.  Exactly *why* is harder to pinpoint.  Perhaps it was your uniform, the smooth embrace of your layers of laminate.  Or your bondage, the sensation of helplessness growing alongside your discomfort, unable to free yourself.  Or perhaps you simply liked being on display, left outside a shop like a bothersome pet.  Certainly the leash hooked to the rear of your collar helped reinforce that.

The third slave&#39;s owner eventually returns, unhooking her before reapplying a leash and leading her away.  You&#39;re not spared much of a glance, and Euphoria at least doesn&#39;t seem bothered-- she retains her strict posture and position, readily showcasing her impressive curves for everyone who passes.

[[An hour eventually slips by.-&gt;Nun17]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2532" name="Nun17" tags="" position="2027,18270" size="100,100">Finally your Master returns.  Petros emerges from the terminal cafe much as he had entered, without much apparent concern for your situation.  He does address you immediately however, checking you over, asking quickly if you had been bothered.  Clearly he didn&#39;t think embarrassment and molestation counted as &#39;bothered&#39; however, and in short order he&#39;s unchaining you.  Euphoria is treated first, the hierarchy of slaves respected, but soon you too are allowed to stand.

To your surprise your muscles protest a bit, lingering pain in your thighs especially burning brightly.  Petros clearly notes your discomfort as he hooks your collar back into place, although his masked visage suggests little sympathy.  His tone is none the better.

&quot;A few weeks collared, and you will get used to it.&quot;  His words seem to suggest the truth, gauging by Euphoria.  Despite being twice your age she appears utterly unbothered.  If that was simple experience, or Torean biomedical wizardry, you cannot tell.

[[A tug on your collar draws you forth once more.-&gt;Nun18]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2533" name="Nun18" tags="" position="2027,18420" size="100,100">Your Master, as always, sets a harsh pace.  By the time Petros finally stops some twenty minutes later you&#39;re breathing heavily through your nose, the heavy steel ring through your septum having proven bothersome.  The street upon which you stand is covered like all the rest, but its the building jutting out before you that draws your attention.

Your address, your destination, is labeled with bold letters: **(colour: &quot;#e619e5&quot;)[CLUB LUSH]**.

The doorway is ornate, curling columns framing each side, seemingly rendered in glass or some other manner of transparent material.  Nearby lights enter them only to refract, spilling out in bright patterns.  It&#39;s enough to distract you momentarily from a choice that presents itself-- but eventually you focus on your immediate concerns.

Not only is the club ornate, it&#39;s guarded by a bouncer, a testament to the Club&#39;s wealth demonstrated by the fact that he&#39;s male.  To the side a short line awaits, and even a quick glance makes it obvious the clientele trends towards the elite.  The only slaves you see are attending a Mistress or Master.  Getting in that way could be pricey.

Petros of course makes that way immediately, dragging you along behind.

[[Those in line glare as you and your escort skip to the front.-&gt;Nun19]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2534" name="Nun19" tags="" position="2027,18570" size="100,100">To your surprise the bouncer doesn&#39;t immediately demand you return to the back of the line, and instead looks Petros up and down.  A moment passes, then two.

&quot;Master Petros, how good of you to join us this evening.&quot;  Reaching to his side, he pushes the door open, then finally turns his attention to you and Euphoria.  &quot;Two Sisters of the Order too?  Oblations?&quot;

Petros shakes his head.  &quot;Their business is their own.&quot;

&quot;Shame, as you know the owner always appreciates when the Order provides free services.&quot;  Gesturing for your small party to pass, he reaches to your rear as you pass, fondling you briefly through the slick laminate of your uniform.

[[Sound indignant!  &quot;Mmmgh!&quot;-&gt;Nun20A]]
[[Mewl happily.  &quot;Mmmgh...&quot;-&gt;Nun20B]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2535" name="Nun20A" tags="" position="1952,18720" size="100,100">&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/DZBI1bG.png&quot; width=&quot;80%&quot; height=&quot;80%&quot;&gt;

&quot;Silence,&quot; Petros commands from his position before you, leading into the neon maw of Club Lush proper.  &quot;This is your path, you have nothing to complain about.&quot;

Stepping through the portal, you&#39;re greeted with a cacophony of sound and color.  Loud, pounding music thrums through your body as much as the air, matched with the flash of strobes and other lights.  Most of the coloration trends towards violet, adding to the otherwise dim atmosphere-- while reflecting brilliantly off the multitudes in attendance.  

Laminate in a thousand different forms glisten before your eyes, each more elaborate or revealing then the last.  The Club is a hive of activity, all of Torei seemingly condensed into this one place: Mistresses and Masters  attended by slaves, tourists gawking at every passing sight, and spread liberally throughout freewombs and other such independents.  Some are seated at the small tables near the center of the room, awash in the glow of neon, while others crowd the stage up front.  Along the edges booths allow for a more intimate audience, shadows hiding most of what went on there beyond the occasional flash of laminate.

Turning about slowly, you momentarily lose yourself in the madness of sensuality that perhaps best personified Torei.  As if to remind you of your place in it all, Lush gives one last look at your current condition via the mirrors flanking the door.  Your heeled boots put you on display as much as anyone else, the posture required of them setting off your suit brilliantly-- which gleams like an obsidian and alabaster ocean, each blast of color from the club itself running down your curvaceous form.  Your full regalia marks you as slave and Sister, while your gags deny speech-- altogether your womanly muscles contract, hungry for attention.  You hardly recognize yourself, or how you feel... knowing only that altogether it makes you so very wet.  

[[Gaze long into the abyss...-&gt;MeetCherishNun]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2536" name="Nun20B" tags="" position="2102,18720" size="100,100">&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/DZBI1bG.png&quot; width=&quot;80%&quot; height=&quot;80%&quot;&gt;

&quot;Silence,&quot; Petros commands from his position before you, leading into the neon maw of Club Lush proper.  But at your side Euphoria glances your way, red eyes gleaming with amusement.

&quot;**Breathtaking**, right?&quot;

It&#39;s only then, the words spoken over your shoulder, that you notice a woman had stepped up behind you.  Petros turns his head to regard her, while you see that she is uniformed-- in tight laminate.  Surrounded by the violet hues of the club, her servant&#39;s livery matches nicely in it&#39;s light shade of blue, being tight across her chest before expanding to a very short skirt.  Just how short it is she demonstrates by lifting it for you while bowing.  You recognize it as that peculiar Torean practice, a very well practiced Torean reverence.

&quot;Allow me to welcome you to Club Lush, my name is Cherish.  As a slave of this establishment, please allow me to service you in whatever manner you deem me capable of.&quot;

Her collar is thin, pulled tight against her throat, fashionable-- and without an observable way for it to be removed.

&quot;A booth,&quot; Petros responds.  &quot;Ground floor, prominent.  Its time your rabble see how two *proper* women serve.&quot;

[[Cherish glances your way, then nods and begins leading the way.-&gt;MeetCherisNun2]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2538" name="MeetCherisNun2" tags="" position="2028,19039" size="100,100">As promised, the booth Cherish leads Petros and his trailing enslaved Sisters is very much the center of attention, directly before the stage and sunken slightly into the ground.  The handful of tables ahead would need to look back, but everyone else in the Club need only glance your way to observe what was about to occur.

&quot;Is there anything else I can do to serve, Master?&quot;  Cherish collects her hands before her as Petros looks upon her selection, nodding thoughtfully before he responds.  &quot;A glass of *Lash*, and be quick about it.&quot;

The slave jumps to the command immediately, while Petros turns to his charges.  Moving to Euphoria, he pulls down her muzzle momentarily, allowing him to remove her gag, but leaves the panel of laminate down.  Euphoria&#39;s marked lips almost glow in the light of the club, **Sinner** and **Slave** shining prominently.  Tossing the gag aside, he leaves you momentarily incapable of speech-- your thoughts were not necessary.

&quot;Thus comes your remittance,&quot; he says with his strange drawl.  &quot;You will pay as a woman should, with her body?&quot;

&quot;Of course,&quot; Euphoria replies, her gloved hands twisting a bit in their restrained position behind her.  &quot;Would you be willing to assist us in accessing the VIP section?  We would of course compensate you further.&quot;

The Master shakes his head.  &quot;I dislike the VIP area, it is quiet and demure.  I do not come to Lush for this.  And besides, you have no legitimate business in such an area, as slaves.&quot;

&quot;As you say,&quot; Euphoria nods, her habit emphasizing the movement.  &quot;But there is a matter we must address, regardless.&quot;

&quot;Then you will need to find some other means of access,&quot; the man replies simply.  &quot;I will hear no more of it.  I would make use of your holes.&quot;

Euphoria nods again, taking his refusal in stride.  &quot;I have only the one of course, but we are slaves, and willing to serve.  She kneels before him as he takes a seat, then turns her red eyes towards you.  *Get down*, they command.

[[You comply.-&gt;Nun21]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2539" name="Nun21" tags="" position="1984,19193" size="100,100">Still hobbled and with your hands behind your back, moving to a kneeling position is difficult-- but you manage.  Cherish returns as you do, depositing the requested drink before withdrawing again.  Petros ignores it, and instead reaches down, pulling down your muzzle.  Like Euphoria, he plucks free your gag.

&quot;Sister,&quot; Euphoria says at your side, kneeling before Petros.  It is strange to see her speak with her lips exposed. &quot;As our escort, it is only natural that we owe Master Petros compensation for his time and efforts.  Given our vows of poverty, we are of course unable to provide this via credits.  Thus we have only the ancient and most holy of ways to repay him, that of our path.  Sensation and pleasure.  Service, as he wills it.&quot;

As if on cue, Petros&#39; gloved hand moves to his midsection, and undoes a zipper just below his navel.  The black of his laminate splits, revealing his manhood, large and imposing, sheathed in black laminate.  Already it stands at attention, and at the tip you glimpse an opening, clearly intended to provide him with the ability to relieve himself.

Euphoria&#39;s lips almost pop into an &#39;O&#39; as if it were a natural reaction, but she collects herself, smiling with those marked lips.  &quot;We will render service together,&quot; she explains.  &quot;You need only follow my lead.&quot;

Still kneeling, wrists linked behind her back, she presents herself as only a Torean slave could.  Chest out, back slightly curved, legs spread, lips opened and ready for service.  

&quot;My holes are yours, Master.&quot;

As always his mask hides his expression, but you sense a certain sort of approval nevertheless.  Reaching out, his hand moves towards your mouth.

You open in response, allowing a submissive expression to shift your marked lips into an inviting &#39;0&#39; as his finger approaches.  Gliding gently atop them, he circles your mouth, eventually entering as you eagerly suck upon the laminate digit.

&quot;There are many slaves on this planet,&quot; he speaks aloud.  &quot;But you are still a beauty among them, even if your uniform is intended to present you as such.  For this you should still be lauded, regardless.  Laminate and bondage suit you.&quot;

He pulls his hand back, wiping your own saliva upon your chin.  &quot;Does bondage please you, slave?&quot;

Petros notes your acknowledgement with a curt nod, even as his hands return to your bound form, drifting to your shoulders.  There he finds the trailing edges of your habit resting, and he draws it back gently, like hair you are no longer capable of displaying.

Your willingness to present your body is met with an approving sound from the man&#39;s mask.

His hands move again, fondling your breasts.  The bottommost layer of your uniform, the catsuit, is well tailored, the breast cups that held your chest providing as much lift and support as they do display.  As his fingers find your nipples Petros pauses, gently kneading them between forefinger and thumb.  Your body instantly reacts, nipples growing hard.  It a reaction he seems pleased with, his mask nodding as he stands back up to his full height.

Inch by inch, his pelvis only finally hilts against your lips *just* as you feel on the verge of choking.

Euphoria meanwhile augments the experience by leaning in, her red eyes gleaming as she suckles upon his balls, her tongue rolling out slowly to tease and play.

Pressing your lips against his member, you kiss the laminate-coated shaft, teasing it as your tongue emerges afterward, wrapping around as much as it could.  Euphoria does the same on the other side, her glossy lips nearly touching your ow.  Your eyes meet, and she winks.

Above you Petros grunts a bit, perhaps surprised.  He certainly approves, as indicated by the way he nods.  &quot;Very good, Sisters.  I would enjoy some prayer during your work.  The Canticle of Submission would be most fitting, I do believe.  Call and return, Euphoria you will of course lead.&quot;

Your elder Sister takes the request entirely in stride, pulling back from his cock just long enough to begin.  &quot;I am a woman, weak and in need of guidance.  I beseech you Master...&quot;

Repeating her words would be difficult, with his cock in your mouth.

Slower.&quot;

Euphoria passes you a supportive glance, all but indicating you should try again.

Without his guiding hand to all but force you it&#39;s almost an entirely different experience the second time, the decision to accept such degrading treatment utterly yours alone to make.  And you do make it, pressing your head forward, taking his manhood into your mouth until you&#39;re all but choking on it.

The Torean Master watches you intently, the bondage you&#39;re in maintaining your posture so that he need only focus solely on the work of your lips and tongue.  He seemed a particularly conservative sort, even by Torean standards-- perhaps that explained his fascination with your technique.  Was this story, the woman upon her knees serving a Master, as old as Torei itself?

&quot;Even gagged on my cock, I would have you at prayer,&quot; he commands.  &quot;As a novitiate you will learn many such prayers by heart, so that you may never forget what you are-- and so that you may tell others as well.  I would have you begin such training now.&quot;

The words spill from your mouth, Euphoria repeating them to join you in a chorus of submission.  Sound carries, even over the din of Club Lush, drawing several stares from those nearby.  Offworlders especially take interest, your regalia, bondage, and prayer providing a better show than the band upon the stage.  

Your Sister ignores them, as you have been commanded, and instead continues.  &quot;...for your strict restraint, for a collar upon my throat...&quot;

Yet even as you prepare the words, Master Petros&#39; cock stands before you.  The first effort has been completed, but now you must settle on a pace that would please the man.  On one hand, eagerness in submission seemed oft rewarded on this planet.  On the other, he seemed inclined to prefer a slower-- more sensual approach.

The only thing you are sure of is that you don&#39;t have long to decide-- already his hand reaches out, intending to guide you back to him.

Yet it is not an experience he allows to go on as long as you intended.  Your reverie is broken by his hand once more landing upon your veiled head, seizing you sharply.

&quot;Do you think me another slave, to tease in this manner?  You are not my soubrette, Sister.&quot;  Forcibly, he drives you hard back onto his cock, directing a much quicker pace to make up for the lost time.  Euphoria meanwhile keeps up her prayer, expecting you to do so as well.

It&#39;s a pace that seems to meet his approval, the occasional grunt of pleasure from the mask even suggesting a quickly growing arousal.  In fact it seems to grow at such a rate that he eventually outpaces you, his hand once more landing upon your veiled head.  His next command is dreadfully simple.

&quot;Faster.&quot;

Just what *that* meant is explained by the plunging of your head forward, back onto his cock, as he begins to drive you faster and faster-- soon outpacing your own self-set pace...

He gives you no time to pause after each stroke, nor even to truly breathe-- you&#39;re merely forced back down upon the laminate shaft, its glossy material gliding across your tongue until it presses against the back of your throat.

It&#39;s an experience that is quickly tiring, even as the Master above growls with pleasure.  Petros was clearly enjoying himself, but honestly you&#39;re not sure how long you can keep this up-- yet Euphoria keeps to her own task as well, continuing to guide you in prayer to the man using you so forcibly.

&quot;Gag me.  Bind me.  Fuck me, Master.  But remember that I am a sinner, and that to spare me is to spoil me...&quot;

Euphoria recognizes what is happening immediately, her prayer concluding as she lifts her chin to reveal her throat-- as much of a hint as she can give.

Somewhere along the way he begins backing out of you, and to your credit you maintain your dedication, not allowing one drop of his seed to spill-- even as his member finally slips from between your lips.

In his wake you&#39;re left panting, those who had been observing staring at your bound form.  You hardly have the cognizance to care about them, as instead you gasp for breath, eagerly sucking down air.  Each heavy breath lifts your breasts, undoubtedly presenting an alluring display.  Your Master however refrains, instead producing a thin-lam handkerchief which he proceeds to use to clean your saliva from his cock.  It almost makes his last command flippant.

Her height eclipses your view of the club, her laminated features filling the circle of vision your habit allowed.  Her lips are fuller then yours, and her breasts more endowed as she leans in, the **Sinner** and **Slave** markings coming together with her own.  

Her tongue enters your mouth and overwhelms your own, exploring freely, furthering the sensation of the elder woman&#39;s kiss.  Its blissful, and frustrating, the desire that had been growing between your legs only heightened by such direct attention.  Even now, bound and in full laminate regalia, with a small crowd watching you have no sense of shame-- not anymore.  You merely indulge in her kiss, in the taste of your Master&#39;s cum upon your tongue, in the ecstasy of it all...

&quot;Bourbon.&quot;  Petros&#39; voice breaks your reverie, and with it Euphoria pulls back, although her lips smile as her eyes gleam.  She licks the former clean, their glossy crimson nature so very appealing that you almost lose focus again.  But with a blink you look away, to where your Master is once more seated, his codpiece restored.  The slave from earlier, Cherish, is taking his order with a nod.

&quot;The debt between us is paid, Sisters, your service rendered,&quot; he notes.  (if: $Strike is &lt; 0)[&quot;And your service, Sister Azalea, was most pleasing.  I understand that you are new to this life, to your collar, but truly you are well fitted to it.  There is little doubt in my mind that you will be presented to me, sometime in the future, to be remade in the Order&#39;s idealized image.

He tips his mask, one hand finding his chin.  Cherish returns, presenting his drink with a flourish.  He takes it, then presses a button on the table.  The slavegirl jumps in surprise, clearly fighting the desire to reach down between her legs.  A reward mechanism of some sort?  Neither figure explains, and besides, Petros looks to you again.  His question is simple.

&quot;Were you aware Sister Euphoria is burdened with chastity?&quot;

Leaning forward, Master Petros undoes the pair of straps that descended from Euphoria&#39;s corset and ran between her legs.  Thus freed, the red of her panties can be pulled down, revealing a hidden feature: a flat portion of silvery steel, positioned directly over her womanhood.  It curves down and between her legs, while the upper portion disappears beneath her corset.  A small lock symbol glows red upon the shield.

&quot;It is a vow of your Order,&quot; Petros explains, even as he begins returning Euphoria&#39;s uniform to its regular state.  &quot;Optional... in a manner of speaking.  If you are without such a vow, you are free to take it at any time.  But you are also a slave, and your Master-- your true Master, the Benefactor of your Order, allows for anyone to enforce the vow upon you.  For a daily tithe, one that can be extended or retracted at will.&quot;

His mask shifts to Euphoria, who had been starkly quiet during the revelation.  Concluding his efforts to cover her again, Petros addresses her directly.  &quot;How long has your current period of chastity been, Sister Euphoria?&quot;

&quot;Eight months, fourteen days,&quot; she answers immediately.

&quot;And how would you describe the burden of chastity?&quot;

At that, Euphoria smiles.  But its a tight expression.  &quot;Enlightening, Master.  An enlightening hell.&quot;

Your passing causes a bit of a commotion with anyone nearby however, your uniforms and Euphoria&#39;s mere proportions standing out even in the cacophony of color and laminate design that is your fellow club-goers.  Nevertheless, instead of making for a table or booth, your Sister leads you to a quiet corner outside the normal walking paths.

&quot;As unaccompanied slaves, we are not allowed a table of our own,&quot; she explains.  &quot;And I thought you might have questions.  About what happened, or... your upcoming vow.&quot;

Few Sisters choose the Vow of Chastity voluntarily, fewer still ever come to peace with it.&quot;

Euphoria glances about Club Lush, taking in the chaotic frenzy of light, laminate, sound and sex that surrounded you both.  Her keen red eyes miss little, and when they bear back down on you from beneath her habit a conviction burns there that sizzles with resolve.  Her gloved hand falls upon your shoulder, the long sleeve of her robe draped over your own dark laminate.

&quot;Our path remains the same, Sister: we must break the bond you have with the AI, and their Daemon.  You must prepare yourself to reject whatever it is that has drawn the eye of such an imposing presence to you.  To do that, we will strike three slaves with one proverbial whip by speaking to the bartender.&quot;

She tips her head in the direction of the bar, a transparent edifice backed by light and packed with clubgoers.  The man in question slinging drinks is rather nondescript, except for his presence of course.  Men rarely worked such menial jobs on Torei.  

&quot;He is the owner,&quot; Euphoria explains.  &quot;Perhaps he will have heard from your contact, whomever it may be.  Even if he has not, I suspect we will need to search the VIP area-- the balcony overlooking this floor.  As slaves we are not allowed in such areas normally unleashed, but the owner is known to our Order.  And I am certain he has access to a Wardrobe here, which we can use to get you belted.&quot;

Her hands come together, head tipping in a quick prayer.  &quot;We may be creatures of sin, Sister, but if we stay to our path we will overcome all before us.  Come.&quot;

[[The sharp snap of her heels and a flourish of her cloak mark a turn towards the bar.-&gt;NunBar]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2585" name="NunBar" tags="" position="1973,22757" size="100,100">Weaving through the tables and crowds, you approach the bar.  A long countertop greets you, the bottom portion darker colored, the top itself translucent.  Lacking stools or chairs of any sort, it&#39;s nevertheless busy-- and he twice skips over what would have been a reasonable opportunity to address you.

&quot;It is proper that he handle freewombs and men before lowly slaves such as us,&quot; Euphoria notes, with all the patience in the world.  So you wait together, ignoring the occasional stare from those who approach the bar to order drinks.  A break eventually comes in the traffic, and with it Club Lush&#39;s owner approaches.

&quot;Sister,&quot; he greets, with more respect than a slave would perhaps otherwise earn.  &quot;My people at the door told me of your arrival, although I understand you are not here on your usual business?&quot;

Euphoria once again performs an elaborate reverence, which you copy, presenting yourself to the man in the proper Torean fashion.  Only then does she respond.  &quot;No, Master.  Unfortunately we are not here to serve your patrons, despite the peace we would undoubtedly find upon our knees.  We are here on Convent business.  Sister, please give the Master your identification card.  We are hoping there is someone here waiting for her?&quot;

[[Hand over your card.-&gt;NunBar2]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2586" name="NunBar2" tags="" position="1973,22907" size="100,100">The ID card the Sisters had returned to you upon conversion is far different then the one you woke with.  Your name is listed as Sister Azalea, and it lacks a picture-- an allowance given to certain religious orders only.  Most prominently, of course, are the bold letters emblazoned along the top: **SLAVE**.  Nevertheless your ID number remains, and with a simple swipe at a terminal nearby the bartender pulls up the relevant information.

&quot;Ah, yes... Your party is waiting in our VIP Suite #4... but they did not provide authorization for you to ascend, and have an outstanding do-not-disturb order so that I cannot contact them about your arrival.&quot;  He returns the card, then clasps his hands together ruefully.  &quot;You understand that I cannot have slaves wandering such an important area...&quot;

&quot;...but there is some matter that our Order could assist with, tonight?&quot;  Euphoria supplies, the smile beneath her muzzle just evident.  &quot;We of course are most ready to do so, are we not Sister Azalea?&quot;

[[&quot;As slaves, we are meant to serve, Master.&quot;-&gt;NunServeY]]

Such discipline from a group without a proper Master watching your every action always amazed me.  Such discipline, and submission.  Which is exactly what I need.&quot;

He turns his attention back to Euphoria.  &quot;I&#39;ll give you a key to take the back way up to the VIP area, so my guests do not see you.  But along the way I would ask you to attend to a slave of mine you will find back there.  One of the serving girls, her name is Akrai... and she is in dire need of discipline.  Just last night I caught her attempting to escape, and she has been undergoing punishment since.  But she is stubborn, Sisters.  Perhaps you can provide the guidance she needs?&quot;

&quot;We can certainly speak to the woman,&quot; Euphoria acknowledges.  &quot;May we ask one more boon, Master?  To use your Wardrobe device, at our own expense of course.  So that I may adjust my Sister&#39;s uniform.&quot;

The bartender slides a key across the counter.  &quot;Sure.  Use the door beside the stage to reach the backroom, you&#39;ll find everything you need back there.&quot;  Several patrons step up to the bar in that moment, and he turns towards them.  Its a rather blunt dismissal, without even much in the way of acknowledgement, but Euphoria takes it-- and the key-- in hand.

Making across the floor and towards the stage, she then shifts to the side, towards a narrow corridor at the end of which a door looms.  *Employees Only* is marked prominently.  Pushing through without hesitation, she waits for you to follow, then closes it behind you.

As the cacophony of the Club lessens, deafened somewhat by the door, you glance about.  You&#39;re greeted with a small antechamber, a glass display of Club Lush&#39;s layout the only real decoration. Having been divided into a number of quadrants, you find names have been stenciled: Thiva, Sparti, Cherish, among others.  One more name is written in red, unassigned to any of the sections: Akrai.  An arrow drawn from the name leads to a label of &quot;Punishment&quot;.

&quot;A well ordered establishment and schedule helps a slave submit, and furthers their own perception of that path before them,&quot; your elder Sister observes, before turning to you.  Into your hand she pushes the data chit Petros had given her.

&quot;You will find the Wardrobe Device that is back here,&quot; she commands, &quot;and you will get yourself belted.  The machine will prompt for a custom ROM, that is what you hold in your hand.  It should be fairly straightforward from there.  I will see to Akrai, but will wait for you to complete your task before we address that one together.  It will be a good lesson for you, Sister.&quot;

Stepping back, she crosses the small room in one stride, her hand finding the handle of the door opposite.  &quot;Try not to wander too much.&quot;

Lockers run along the walls, one of them hanging open revealing a uniform much like those you had seen the bouncers outside the Club wearing.  Presumably this was where they came to store any personal effects while on the job.

More importantly, three doors lead from the room, and these are each labeled.  The one directly before you is ajar, presumably where Euphoria had gone.

[[Enter the door to your left, labeled STORAGE.-&gt;NBRStorage]]
[[Enter the door directly before you, labeled SLAVE QUARTERS.-&gt;NBRSlaves]]

Most appear to be lights and tablecloths, alongside other decorations capable of transforming Lush into any number of themes.  One area is marked *A Night in Hell*, another *Damsels in Distress* and a third *Polar Expedition.*  

It appears you caught the Club on a rather tame night, all things considered.

[[Return the way you came in.-&gt;NunBack2]]

Several desks are up against the walls, mirrors atop them surrounded by lights to ease the application or adjustment of makeup, or one&#39;s wardrobe.  Larger full length mirrors at each corner provide much the same purpose, as demonstrated by the bottles of *Laminate Shine* you find on nearby tables.  

More labeled doors await you.

The quiet allows you for the first time to hear something, though-- the unmistakable sound of gagged moans from the door to your right.

[[Take the door to your left, labeled WARDROBE DEVICE.-&gt;NBRWardrobe]]

Unfortunately cage like bars intercede, blocking your path to the staircase proper.  A door allows passage through, but it is closed-- and when your hand tests the handle you find it locked.  Euphoria had been given the key that would provide access, and she retained it still.  

You should be moving on anyway.

Given Lush&#39;s large bar, and its distinct collection of intoxicants both Torean and Offworld-originating, its perhaps no small wonder they kept a extra stock back here.

Beyond that, you don&#39;t see much of interest.

[[Step back.-&gt;NBRStorage]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2596" name="NBRStorageU" tags="" position="2452,23501" size="100,100">The upper rows of the storage area are filled with several devices you immediately recognize as having a very *carnal* intent.  Most appear to feature different means of interacting with the female anatomy, be it via vibrating nubs, plunging phalli, or in one particular case something that looks like a pulley lined with metallic tabs-- to which purpose you can only imagine.

Lush&#39;s slaves apparently had their work cut out for them, on occasion.

[[Step back.-&gt;NBRStorage]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2597" name="NBRStorageP" tags="" position="2575,23501" size="100,100">Several posters, larger then you are tall even with the added height of your heels, are collected in the storage room&#39;s corner.  Moving to unfurl the first, if only to sate your idle curiosity, its then you notice something else behind the posters.  Pushing them aside takes a good moment, but when you do you&#39;re rewarded with an unexpected sight: a door, obviously hidden.  Just where it went is impossible to determine, the portal lacking any manner of view beyond it.  You do however find something else jammed into the doorframe itself, a small folding blade.  Given its position, it almost looked like someone had been trying to pry the door open.  It doesn&#39;t appear they succeeded, and you see no other way of opening it. (if: $Escape is true)[

*This must have been how the slave Akrai attempted to escape the Club, only to be found and sentenced to her current fate.  Just what this door was intended for, or how Akrai had intended to open it with a mere knife isn&#39;t exactly clear, but you pick up the weapon as proof of your discovery.  Perhaps Sister Euphoria will have further insight.* (set: $EscapeFound to true)] 

[[Step back.-&gt;NBRStorage]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2598" name="NBRWardrobe" tags="" position="1639,23670" size="100,100">Entering the room, you come upon a rare thing indeed-- something your amnesia-wracked mind can recognize.  The Wardrobe Device before you looks a bit different then the one you encountered at the Hotel this morning, but the *glass* display built into the front is running on the same operating system from before.  

There are also several cases stacked to the side of the room, their exteriors either a particularly shiny plastic or (more likely) a utilitarian form of laminate.

It&#39;s remarkably well furnished, the rather large room having tall vaulted ceilings, a small balcony atop centered on what appeared to be a fireplace of sorts.  Vid-screens and comfortable looking couches occupy the lower floor, along with a kitchenette, separated by an island-like counter of considerable length.

Thankfully the room remains unoccupied, for the time being at least.

These have to be the manner in which Club Lush kept its slaves at night, you imagine, a handful of personal accoutrements decorating each-- alongside a name.  Third on your left, you notice Cherish&#39;s cell.

The sounds you had heard are louder here, and its in the furthest cell you see someone moving-- a form of red and black laminate, wriggling to the sound of lurid moans atop the bed which she is strapped to.  

The name on the cell is *Akrai*, and above her stands Euphoria, hands clasped in prayer.

Before you can even begin reading the fine print below, however, the screen flashes with an override warning and the device itself unlocks for you-- clearly the Club&#39;s owner had sent ahead his credentials.

A splash of color slides across the screen, and with it comes unbridled access to the Wardrobe Device.  Unlike the machine you utilized at the hotel, this one appears to have full access to a potential inventory of outfits several thousand pages long.  You may have harbored a desire to explore them at length, but a vow of poverty prevented you from purchasing any of them-- besides that which the data chit you hold would allow of course.  Finding the slot into which to slide it is easy enough, and after a moment to load the screen changes yet again.  Stark text greets you:

=&gt;&lt;=
***Slave Protocols Activated.***
*Selected: Slave-Rated Long Term Chastity Belt (Steel)*
*Options Selected: Removable Anal Shield, Custom Fitting, Digital Keyed*

(text-style: &quot;blink&quot;)[SUBMIT TO SELECTION?]
&lt;==

The blinking text flashes in your mind, the promise of enforced chastity a mere button press away.  To your shame, the mere idea thrills you in a way you did not think possible.  Had you truly fallen to Torei&#39;s siren song so far as to revel in this fate?  You&#39;re already collared, restraints locked onto your wrists and ankles permanently.  A slave.  Which meant you had little in the way of choice, but Euphoria had allowed you some here-- she could have easily overseen the installation.  Is she testing you?

Pulling forth the first bit your hands seize up reveals it to be a pre-formed outfit, a leotard of cyan so bright as to be almost neon unto itself.  Lacking anything for the legs, the arms would be covered by sleeves.  On the back and framing the peephole opening built into the chest are Club Lush&#39;s logo.

You conclude this must one of the relatively rare cases where the Wardrobe Device nearby couldn&#39;t easily recreate the outfit, probably due to the particular brightness of the laminate, and as such had been crafted in a more traditional manner and then shipped in.

Just more shoes.  Given that the cases were sealed and clearly well sorted, perhaps that shouldn&#39;t have been unexpected.

Whatever you were so intent on searching for isn&#39;t here, at least.

Its exterior may have seemed a bit different, but the interior is identical.  Tiled floor and walls, several oddly shaped for the inevitable emergence of the device&#39;s armatures-- and another interior control screen, blinking for you attention.

Your designated installation package requires secondary confirmation.  Customized confirmation text follows:

*By entering this Wardrobe, Slave Sister Azalea of the Order of the Primrose, you are submitting to the Vow of Chastity.  As recognized by your Order, this vow will remain in force until your designated benefactor decided to remove it.  This right has no expiration date and can be conveyed to next of kin via lawful will.*

*Do you submit to the Vow of Chastity, and recognized that access to your own womanhood shall no longer be allowed to you?  That you are incapable of restraint and are in need of a belt to retain your own dignity?  That you are a woman, weak by nature, and in need of this guidance?*

With the door shut behind you, there is truly no turning back now.

The fire itself is not lit, but even so its not hard to imagine Lush&#39;s slaves seated her early in the morning-- given their undoubtedly all-night work in the club proper-- winding down.

Peeking inside the icebox reveals it to be well stocked, a fact that is perhaps a bit surprising given how slaves on Torei were generally treated.  Perhaps it served as a perk?  You&#39;re certainly hungry enough to consider it a proper proposition, but cannot sate that desire now-- you have much greater concerns elsewhere.

Otherwise the area is relatively unremarkable.

Bright, glossy photoshoots fill equally glossy pages, a moment&#39;s examination confirming how very Torean of a publication it is: even the material of the pages themselves is laminate thinprint.  Flipping through several pages reveals an examination of upcoming fashion lines, the current fad being based around exclusivity.   Instead of being freely available from Wardrobe devices, it appears most of the current designs must be special ordered preformed.

An interesting read, but of little use to you otherwise.

Despite the quiet civility of the room, its a stark reminder of Torei&#39;s culture of bondage and hierarchy.  It was always there, really-- just waiting for someone like you to stumble.

Carefully.-&gt;NBRLoungeFire]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2612" name="NBRUpUp" tags="" position="2174,24007" size="100,100">Moving to the railing, you are given a nearly bird&#39;s eye view of the slave quarters.  If you were hoping for a particularly insightful revelation, or for keen eyes to spot anything in particular however-- you&#39;re sorely mistaken.  Instead you&#39;re met with the simple truth that many slaves on Torei lived in relative luxury.  Were it not the lingering sense of pervasive slavery, this room could have been a nice penthouse on any other planet.

 Greeting you, a primly dressed woman in glossy red laminate smiles into the camera, a collar pulled tight around her throat boldly proclaiming her to be &#39;Property of TNN&#39;.

&quot;Welcome back to the Torean News Network,&quot; she greets, as bright and chipper as her outfit.  &quot;As always, my name is Anna Karis and these are your top stories for the Ringdom of Aekora.&quot;

She shuffles the thinprint laminate sheets on the desk before her.  &quot;Offworld-born pop star Reya Tianna shocked fans today by revealing that she had accepted a collar, and will be retiring from public performances to fulfill its obligations.  Tianna has not revealed the name of her new owner, and speculation runs rampant as for her reasoning for entering into service, but many have been quick to point with the singer&#39;s twice extended stay on Torei and images of her from earlier this month in strict bondage indicating what could be a sincere desire for enslavement.&quot;

The newswoman smiles.  &quot;Offworlder protests have been reported as fierce, but when pressed for comment local officials have confirmed the legitimacy of Miss Tianna&#39;s right to servitude, a proud Torean cultural heritage and institution.&quot;

It takes a moment, but with a bit of shock you finally realize what made it so very Torean.  Instead of horses, or other creatures of burden, each chariot is instead pulled by a team of six women-- ponygirls-- each team of them wearing the same brightly colored laminate beneath their tack and harness.  Given the cloven heels each are wearing you&#39;re surprised to see them maintaining a full sprint easily, although the way their drivers lash them mercilessly from on high explains their motivation.  

As you watch a team crosses the finish line, breaking a laminate band stretched across the field.  They&#39;re met with furious applause and cheering from the stands as the camera rushes towards the driver for what soon becomes a post-race interview.  Of the panting, moaning women locked together nearby little attention is given.

Given the reference to longwave, you conclude this particular channel has to be coming in from far away, perhaps bounced off the atmosphere from the other side of the planet.

If the channel itself is ancient, the program playing is almost beyond time itself.  It appears to document a mother and daughter&#39;s fictionalized life on a homestead in what&#39;s referred to as the &#39;Lichen Belt&#39;, an area depicted as mostly desolate.  What&#39;s most shocking however are the slaves, many included in the background almost as an afterthought-- one baking in the kitchen, another locked spread-eagled to the wall of the family&#39;s home, two more distantly pulling a plow in the fields.

If this was a view of rural Torei, it seemed the ease of obtaining slaves applied even there.

You remember only snippets of your last ride on the elevator, but you do get a sense that the passenger carriage was quite large-- a fact confirmed by the relative rarity of departures and arrivals noted on the screen.

You can still see the listing for the midnight ascent to which you had held a ticket, but with the benefit of experience you search around for the expected, and find it near the bottom.  A disclaimer, noting access to the International Zone and the Way Up was strictly prohibited to indentured servants and the enslaved.  Your collar, pulled tight around your throat, is all the more evident in that moment.

Strapped securely to the bed, a woman covered from head to toe in a dark red catsuit struggles against her restraints.  Each accessory across her body, corset and collar, cuffs and gloves, providing a darker contrast by being completely black.  She&#39;s moaning into the band pulled across her mouth, but rising above even that sound is the constant purr of what could only be multiple vibrators locked within her glistening suit.

A quick examination reveals the majority of her restraints securely anchored, but her gag at least lacks locks-- likely a utilitarian decision, making communication with her captors available at their will.  As it stands, however, Euphoria remains motionless above.  Her hands are clasped together in prayer, eyes closed, but one red orb does reveal itself as you move up beside her.

&quot;Sister Azalea,&quot; she greets calmly, voice rising over the moans of the woman before her.  (if: $Escape is false)[&quot;Is it not a wonderful sight to see a slave in torturous ecstasy?&quot;

To be bound and gagged as our owners demand, to please them with our tribulations, with the path of pleasure and struggle we walk?  Perhaps I will submit us both to such a session at the Convent, upon our return?&quot;

The taller woman breaks from her praying pose and allows a hand to settle upon the bound slave, her gloved fingers dancing over a full breast.  Akrai&#39;s struggles intensify as a result.  &quot;Ah, but this is a punishment-- and more intensive then the slave is probably aware.  Note her laminate, Sister.

You speak of the door you found in the storage area, its use unknown, but with clear attempts having been made at opening it.  When she prompts you for evidence you produce the knife, its dulled tip still marred with bits of shaved metal from its failed attempt at disengaging the door.

Your elder Sister concludes with a nod, instructing you to put down the knife nearby before she continues.  &quot;A simple enough story, then.  Very good.  Anything more elaborate would have indicated a distinct lack of care given to the keeping of this establishment&#39;s slaves.  There are but two entrances to these backrooms: the one through which we walked, and the staircase that leads upstairs.  With both locked often enough, Akrai chose the only other route for her attempted escape: the door you found.&quot;

The bound slave before you continues to writhe in her bonds and punishment, but Euphoria gives little heed.  She was instructing you, and there must always be time enough for that.  &quot;Did you know this Ringdom, Aekora, has a small aquifer?  Not much by offworlder standards, of course, but given the wealth liquid water represents on Torei it is considerable nevertheless.  And it is fed by a series of underground tubes, old lava channels the AIs carved out while they still held dominion over this world in its entirety.  That is where the door you found leads, I would think.  Just as many other buildings around here have similar access.&quot;

She tips her head slightly to the side, her habit sliding across sloped shoulders.  &quot;Smuggling, storage, or just betting that perhaps one day the AIs will return waterflow to most of the system.  Whatever the case may be, if the slave before us reached those tunnels... she could have gotten at least outside Grand Aekora proper before anyone notice.  How very clever.&quot;  Euphoria looks to Akrai, but then turns her red-eyed gaze to you.  &quot;Tell me, Sister: how common do you think runaway slaves are?&quot;

[[&quot;Very common, Sister?&quot;-&gt;NunCommon]]
[[&quot;Somewhat common, Sister?&quot;-&gt;NunSomewhat]]
[[&quot;Not common at all, Sister?&quot;-&gt;NunNotCom]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2622" name="BeltedTalk" tags="" position="2450,24480" size="100,100">Sister Euphoria turns, her long cloak flaring as her hands fall upon your shoulders.  &quot;Truly?  Hands behind your back, legs spread.&quot;

You comply almost without conscious thought, such submission coming to easily to you.  Euphoria responds immediately by stepping closer, surprisingly close, her gleaming laminate pressing against yours as curvaceous forms entwine.  She hooks one leg around your own, spreading you further, while a hand lifts your chin.  The maneuver allows your eyes to meet more readily, her red gaze as always a bit unnerving in its unnatural nature, but it is below where your true concern quickly settles.   Her other hand had fallen to your hips, then slid down to the meeting of your legs.  There she slides beneath the laminate of your panties, the tight cling not enough to prevent her access.

Your freshly installed chastity, however, is another story entirely.  Steel does not budge, nor give way, and in that moment you sense something beyond the serene intensity that marked your elder Sister.  *Pity.*

&quot;You have joined an altogether different Sisterhood now,&quot; she remarks, then presses her own hips forward.  The tight straps running between her legs strain, just audible enough to hear, as she brings her own womanhood up against yours.  Steel to steel, both rendered chaste.  Towering above you, Euphoria&#39;s veiled head eclipses the pale light above, drowning you in shadow as pulls down her muzzle to reveal her marked lips.  Such intimacy marks her question more than anything outwardly sensual could have.

&quot;Know that I pray for you, young Azalea.  Not for you in the now, your first quiet hours in such a state.  But for my Sister three months from now, eternally frustrated.  For the begging you will undertake in half a year, willing to do anything for release, yet *still* incapable of achieving it.  Chastity is a cruelty, Sister.  But a burden you need not bear alone.  As Sisters, as women, as slaves-- we share your pain.&quot;

[[Look down, and nod.-&gt;Belted2]]
[[&quot;T-Thank you, Sister.&quot;-&gt;Belted2]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2623" name="NBRWard4" tags="" position="1565,24120" size="100,100">The Wardrobe, as always, wastes little time.  As you&#39;re already fitted with cuffs at neck, wrists, and ankles the Wardrobe abandons its usual gripping arms and instead uses simple hooks to lock into the hardpoints mounted on your restraints.  From such mounts it is trivial to spread your legs and raise your arms above your head in preparation.

The familiar ring-shaped central apparatus then descends, smaller devices grasping at your corset and the laminate panties you wore upon your catsuit.  Both are removed, freeing the way for the belt that is produced from one of the oddly shaped storage sections along the side wall.  Its such a simple thing to mean so much, but that fact that it emerges pre-formed speaks to the rarity of such devices on Torei.  Steel was a rare resource, all but monopolized for use in restraints until certain Ringdoms had started building towers around the space elevator.  Sisters of the Order may be subjected to all the difficulties of poverty, but the network of donators and benefactors ensured *anything* was available if someone took enough of an interest.

Sliding the belt up between your waiting legs, it is remarkably cool to the touch as the band begins to tighten around the narrowest portion of your waist.  The catsuit base of your uniform remained however, and it quickly warms the newly added metal and laminate as the Wardrobe&#39;s armatures spring forth.  The U-shaped bottom portion is positioned next, the shield across your womanhood leading down between your legs, where a secondary (and removable) portion covered your rear entrance.  From there it rose again, linking with the band at at your back.  

Inch by inch it is cinched closed, growing tighter with every adjustment, until the belt itself firmly embraces you.  Only then do the arms retract, a singular one remaining to press against your shield, delivering a command.  With a sharp *click* the chastity is locked, and a glowing LED ignites just above your sealed womanhood.

Vow of Chastity Belt: *hidden beneath your uniform&#39;s corset and panties, your chastity is nevertheless hard to ignore.  The belt itself is steel backed with laminate, the band hugging the narrowest portion of your waist while the shield prevents any manner of access to your cunt.  An indicator LED is just above the shield itself, glowing red to indicate it remains* **locked**.  *Your frustration builds with every moment sealed inside.*</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2625" name="NBRWard5" tags="" position="1417,24259" size="100,100">You feel your new belt shift as your hips move, but the Wardrobe continues with its work, unperturbed by your struggle to adapt to the new sensations.  Observation of your belt was not intended for most, and thus your corset and panties are thus returned.  A dozen different armatures make short work of the work, particularly delicate manipulators in particular lacing you in quickly-- trimming off inches before replacing the locks, ensuring your waist would remain at the proportions desired by the Order.

Its all done so quickly, so deftly, you&#39;ve hardly gotten used to the restraints before the Wardrobe removes them and cycles back down into dormancy.  You&#39;re done, your new chastity installed, and as your hands come back down to explore the edition you find it all but impossible to even see the belt itself.  But its there, just as readily as Sister Euphoria&#39;s, denying you access to your own desires.  

Just how effective could it be, though?

[[Try to touch yourself.-&gt;NBRWard6No]]
[[Exit the Wardrobe.-&gt;NBRWard6Exit]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2626" name="NBRWard6No" tags="" position="1299,24411" size="100,100">Reaching down, your gloved fingers slide beneath the thin laminate of your panties.  The belt awaits, the steel pulled tightly against your womanhood, the laminate backing all but sealed to your catsuit.  Try as you might, and curiosity-- or perhaps simple desire-- pushes you to try for several minutes, you cannot access your most sacred nexus.  The belt allows no friction, not even the sweet tease of shifting laminate against your feminine lips.  There is only the frustration, which builds, the mere thought of being denied something so simple inducing a quiet ecstasy you cannot escape.

And indeed, the incapacity was entirely intentional.  Sister Euphoria had mentioned it had been *eight months* since her last period without a belt.  Just what would THAT feel like?  The lighting up of the Wardrobe&#39;s interior screen interrupts any such thoughts, words printing out upon its glass display.

*Slave, lingering in a Wardrobe is strictly prohibited.  Vacate, or corrective action will be applied.*

[[What could a Wardrobe do?-&gt;NBRWardZap]]

Curiosity then drives you further, so that you reach down to press a curious hand between your legs.  The belt is there, smooth steel beneath the laminate of your panties.  Unyielding.  Strict.  Utterly domineering.  That you no longer controlled access to your own body is noted by the Wardrobe&#39;s exterior panel, which lights up once more.

*Your digital key has been transmitted to your Master, Mistress, Governess, or assigned figure of authority.*

To the Convent then, or perhaps Petros himself.  Either way, you will be belted until the Master decided to allow your release.

Standing with your back to the door, you observe one of the inner panels opening, an arm emerging.  Where others had been grasping hands, or multitools, this one is singular in purpose and intent.  The tip of arm is U-shaped, and between those outstretched prongs a sliver of electricity jumps.  

Pure instinct backs you towards the door, but you&#39;ve lingered too long, and at full extension it presses into your rear just as you turn.  The shock is *immediate*, a strange sensation that quickly devolves into little more than an insistent pain.  You help, hands on your rear, and all but leap from the Wardrobe-- back into the room beyond.

There, still rubbing your rear, you reach down to press a curious hand between your legs.  The belt is there, smooth steel beneath the laminate of your panties.  Unyielding.  Strict.  Utterly domineering.  That you no longer controlled access to your own body is noted by the Wardrobe&#39;s exterior panel, which lights up once more.

The fingers that had been exploring the rounded expanse of Akrai&#39;s breasts tighten together at her nipple, tweaking the sensitive bud by the piercings evident through her laminate.  The slave writhes in frustrated impotence, while beneath her muzzle Euphoria only seems to smile wider.

&quot;This uniform is what patients of the Ministry of Improvements are issued,&quot; she informs you matter-of-factly, ignoring the gagged protestations coming from the bound figure.  &quot;It would seem the Master of this establishment intends to rectify his recalcitrant slave&#39;s behavior via *improvement.*&quot;

Her hand withdraws from Akrai&#39;s chest so that it can collect together with the other before her corseted waist.  &quot;A full tracking chip is obvious, given her attempted flight.  But one can imagine the good Master will go further, perhaps a full Rainbow implant suite?  They are a remarkable bit of invention, Sister.  Imagine a set of subdermal implants that can be activated remotely, perhaps if one wanders too far from her home, and that can deliver unimaginable pain-- or pleasure without a hand upon the slave, or a wand between her legs.  Often they&#39;re used to enforce orgasm denial.&quot;

Such a fate clearly distress Akrai, but her restraints hold, and Euphoria ignores her entirely.  Instead she turns more fully to regard you.  &quot;As you may recall, the Master asked us for our advice with regards to this slave.  To make any judgement, however, we must fully understand her motivations, her intentions.  For that we must know how she attempted to escape, and how close she came to succeeding.  Sister, I would like you to seek out this information-- I suspect it can be found somewhere within these backrooms.  Return to me with whatever evidence you find, and of course your belt installed.  Then we can determine her fate.&quot;

The smooth laminate of her uniform glides effortlessly against the material of your gloves, guiding your fingers together where they meet at her nipple.  There you find a piercing standing out against the laminate which you seize, tweaking gently.  The slave writhes in frustrated impotence, while beneath her muzzle Euphoria only seems to smile wider.

There she kneels, placing the briefcase upon the ground as she opens it.  (if: $Slave is false)[Several pieces of gear gleam with the promise of wicked intent as she pulls the first forth, and hands it to you.  A glossy black ball gag set into a head harness.

&quot;Remember to seat the ball behind your teeth, the gag is far more effective that way.&quot;  Her smile is professional but a bit impatient, as even now she holds your other pieces of gear in her hands.  Without much recourse you comply, sliding the ball into place.  The attendant does at least help secure it, although the way she cinches the straps is far tighter than you probably would have done yourself.]

(if: $Level is &lt; 1)[Kneeling again, the attendant affixes a chain between your legs via a pair of simple cuffs added to your outfit.  The length is short, clearly intended to limited just how far you could move with each step.](if: $Level is &gt; 0)[&quot;Normally this would be the point where I provide you with a hobble chain,&quot; she notes, &quot;but you are already equipped with such gear.

She doesn&#39;t wait for an answer.]  (if: $Level is &gt; 1)[&quot;Of course I see that you are also wearing an armbinder.  We do have a wonderful reverse-prayer harness that I would normally apply, but obviously that is not possible at the moment.  Such a shame.  The Sisters do enjoy that particular means of restraint.

Her touch is firm, and not particularly gentle, as she attaches cuff she links together with a small clip. A chain is then run up, forcing your hands up in a terribly unnatural way, until it can be connected to the waiting d-ring at the back of a collar she provides as well.  The result is a position of reverse prayer, an aching pain already rising in your forearms and shoulders.]  &quot;One last thing,&quot; your attendant smiles.

Just what she meant is revealed by a simple piece of laminate, a blindfold she swiftly places across your eyes.  It would have been trivial to remove had you not been so thoroughly bound in the proceeding moments, such that you can hardly utter a gagged moan as your vision is reduced to a black void.  It is almost as an afterthought that a leash in run from your temporary collar to the lead system proper above, waiting to draw you blindly forward.

&quot;My advice?&quot;  The attendant whispers, leaning in.  &quot;Focus on the leash.  You have *quite* the walk ahead of you!&quot;

As if on cue the Lead kicks suddenly into motion, pulling you forward.  Stepping, your hobble chain almost immediately goes taut.  The Lead hardly cares, requiring a great deal of effort as you struggle to take your next step.  Blindfolded, it takes you a longer moment to notice the curving of your leash, the Lead moving to join into a singular track, merging with its fellows as it entered the city proper.

Already you&#39;re breathing heavily through your nose.

[[It&#39;s going to be a long walk.-&gt;NunLeave4]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2637" name="NunLeave4" tags="" position="8157,12325" size="100,100">It&#39;s little wonder the Lead system seemed reserved for slaves, and those freewombs incapable of paying for better transport-- somewhere past the first hour mark of your forced march you&#39;re feeling the effects of your accumulated gear thus far.  You&#39;ve been on your feet most of the day after all, and given your boots that meant doing so in sharp stiletto heels.  Your toes ache and your ankles burn, joining the sharp pain that comes from your strictly pinned arms.  Meanwhile the gag between your lips effectively denies breathing through the mouth, requiring your nose to perform the heavy labor.

You cannot help but struggle somewhat, moaning lewdly into your gag as you shift your shoulders.  All that does is wiggle your breasts(if: $Level is &gt; 2)[, the piercings embedded in each nipple making themselves known as the soft flesh shifts].  Had you more control over yourself perhaps you would have considered the way the raised walkway seemed designed to put you on display, the Lead being little more then a high tech slave coffle, your humiliation and submission so clearly demonstrated for any passerby.

If you fail to step forward, it all but drags you by your leash.  The pace is automatically set, and your blindness is ignored.  The tug of the Lead becomes your only sense of guidance, your hobbled steps requiring intense concentration.  Somewhere along the way you learn to shift your arms just a bit, preventing the worst of the pain that results from their enforced position, but it&#39;s a small mercy in the face of such tribulation.

Altogether its a bit hard to believe the Sisters of the Order apparently *enjoyed* this treatment, and underwent it frequently!

The power of revelation only dawns on you when the Lead finally pulls to a sudden halt, and you&#39;re suddenly granted a glorious moment to rest your tired legs.

Just what had caused the stoppage is revealed after another few minutes of waiting, when hands suddenly move across your laminate covered face.  You had left the city&#39;s outskirts to a setting sun, but now dusk has firmly descended as you are greeted by another transit attendant.  Glancing around, you recognize a transport platform much like that which you had departed from-- but this one is much larger, with towering buildings rising up on all sides.

Your temporary restraints are removed, returning you the state of (relative) liberty you had enjoyed prior to the Lead.  Instead of the casual enthusiasm of the other attendant, however, this one is silent and dedicated to her duties.  At least she doesn&#39;t comment on the indignity of your situation, or ask why a woman would willing choose full restraint while traveling.  Eventually you&#39;re directed to step away, towards the Lead platform&#39;s exit.

There are no security checks or other impediments going forward, although the crowds do require some navigating before you pull free, slipping into an empty balcony overlooking the city beyond.

When she releases you she finally steps back, smoothing out her laminate for a moment before she collects her hands before her once more.  &quot;Let us turn to Akrai, then.&quot;

The slave question remains as she had been thus far, wriggling in her bondage, incapable of escaping the hearty churn of the vibrators sealed inside her.  By any sane standard it would have been a horrific-- or perhaps exciting-- manner of torture, but on Torei it was merely the norm.  Euphoria continues to all but ignore her, focusing instead on you.

&quot;As we discussed, the Master of this establishment clearly intends to send this young slave away for improvement at the Ministry.  This would be effective, but blunt.  It is my belief that a more subtle means of encouragement may better serve her education, and further her path to ecstasy as a slave.&quot;  The mere suggestion of a reprieve earns the first halt in Akrai&#39;s struggling, if only for a moment, but Euphoria ignores that too.

&quot;You too stand to learn a lesson in this, Sister, and thus I will be deferring the choice of Akrai&#39;s punishment to *you*.&quot;

[[&quot;To me?&quot;-&gt;Belted3]]
[[&quot;What are my choices?&quot;-&gt;Belted3]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2644" name="Belted3" tags="" position="2450,24780" size="100,100">&quot;I see three potential paths towards the enlightenment Akrai needs,&quot; Euphoria replies.  &quot;The first would address her apparent desire to walk these streets without a collar, a most horrid fate as I&#39;m sure you would agree.  As such, we would suggest to the Master of this establishment that Akrai undertake what we in the Order call a March of Atonement.  You have walked the Lead with me, and know of a bit of that experience.  The March is long and arduous, especially restrained in the manner we would supply.  Eight hours at least, moving throughout Grand Aekora.  And of course she would be outfitted with markings that speak publicly of her sins.&quot;

Three fingers rise on the Sister&#39;s gloved hand.  One falls, then a second.  &quot;Another punishment would address instead Akrai&#39;s sense of dignity, that terrible rejection of one&#39;s place that has driven her to sin.  Public display and free use would address such failings, we in fact have a set of permanent stockades near the Convent for such purposes.  And I do mean *free*, all holes available for use.  Although we do of course accept donations towards our Order throughout.&quot;

The last finger falls, and with it Euphoria lowers her hand.  &quot;The final choice is that... of mercy.  I would not recommend it, and I do not believe it would service Akrai&#39;s path, but I ceded the choice to you, Sister.  It is only proper you select from all available options.  By extending your mercy to Akrai, you would return her to her usual service.  Nothing more would be required of her.&quot;

Your habit shields your eyes as you gaze upon Akrai, her bound form so smooth and glossy, her torturous ecstasy almost making you jealous in that moment.  You fight the urge to reach down, to press your hand against the steel of your belt.  *Focus.*  You have a choice to make.

You have the right to extend mercy if you think it just.  But as with any fork in the road upon our paths, there are consequences.  Many unforeseen.  Are you sure this is what you desire?&quot;

When she does finally speak there is a hint of surprise in her tone, flavored with a healthy dose of approval.  &quot;That is... not an orthodox request, Sister.  But a clever one, perhaps.  The good Master of this establishment will see some manner of improvement with the choices I presented you, but there are no guarantees.  But to take Akrai into the Order for some time, as a Novitiate?  There would be *ample* opportunity to provide the guidance she so clearly needs...&quot;

Euphoria clasps her hands together.  &quot;I believe I could persuade the good Master to allow this path, if that is what you choose.  Akrai is already a slave, she has no proper choice in how her Master uses her.  If he gives her to us for instruction... yes, yes.  It is possible, if that is truly what you desire.&quot;

The key the bartender had provided allows your Sister access with a simple swipe, and you begin to ascend, the narrow steps requiring careful placement of your heeled boots.  Glancing down briefly, you notice Euphoria is making contact only with her toes, and by emulating it you manage to keep pace.  

&quot;Two pieces are required us, to ensure the Daemon ends its pursuit of you.  The first is upon me, and I will provide what is necessary, as I promised before your conversion.  What you must do, however, is far harder.  Whatever it offers, and a Daemon is capable of offering most anything, you must reject it.  Do you understand me, Sister?  It must be clear to the creature that you no longer seek what it is provided to give.  There can be no deal.&quot;

At the top of the stairs another door awaits, and while Euphoria places her hand upon it she halts, turning to you.  &quot;I need to hear you say it, Sister.  You *must* reject the Daemon.&quot;

[[&quot;I understand, I will reject it.&quot;-&gt;NunDeal2]]
[[&quot;What am I even rejecting?&quot;-&gt;NunDealWhat]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2657" name="NunDeal2" tags="" position="2445,25558" size="100,100">&quot;Very good.&quot;  Reaching towards you, the Sister adjusts your habit, then shifts the d-ring that hangs from your collar just a bit.  &quot;Prepare yourself, then.  It is a rare day indeed one draws the attention of Mazos and Dahom, the old gods of this world.  Rarer still is the day such attention proves to be anything but a curse.&quot;

The door before you opens, and together you spill out to find yourself on a balcony.  This one you recognize as the VIP area glimpsed from the floor before, overlooking the rest of the club itself.  A handful of plush seating areas are occupied, but its towards the hallway along the back wall that you&#39;re lead.  Here the doors are numbered, one through six, and you suddenly realize where you are: the private rooms.  Apparently your deal was to take place in #4.  Coming to a stop before it, the door itself is much the same as any other, the neon number glowing silently.

You&#39;ve made it.  Despite everything you&#39;ve endured, at the hotel, on the Torean streets, and inside this very Club-- your goal once upon a time is now merely a few steps away.  *The deal.*  You don&#39;t remember the terms, but from what you&#39;ve collected together it simply **must** have been worth all the effort.  Torei was a land of strange wonders, after all, but you&#39;ve changed.  Six vows, the collar around your throat, the uniform you cannot remove.  You&#39;re a slave Sister of the Order of the Primrose now, and this last hurdle must be cleared before you could truly relax into your service, instruction, and bondage.  

&quot;We maintain decorum until circumstances prove otherwise,&quot; Euphoria instructs.  &quot;Knock.&quot;

[[Knock.-&gt;NunDeal3]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2658" name="NunDealWhat" tags="" position="2595,25559" size="100,100">&quot;We have no way of knowing, not with the drug you took to erase your own memory.

No one answers.

&quot;A Sister of the, oh no--&quot;  What had been frustration shifts upon his face, sliding towards panic.  He moves to close the door in your face, but Euphoria&#39;s size for once is made apparent, a firm hand upon it halting his efforts as she steps forward.

&quot;*Daemon-worshipper*, she hisses.  &quot;You will show us your Master, boy.  Certainly you know what we Sisters do to the profligate.&quot;

The man, already sheet white, nearly collapses from fright.  But he does stand back, clearing the way for Euphoria to stride confidently into the room.  

[[Follow her inside.-&gt;NunDeal6]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2662" name="NunDeal6" tags="" position="2445,26158" size="100,100">Stepping inside the suite reveals it to be sumptuously decorated in dark hues, the most dramatic being laminate material hanging in ridges from a center point in the ceiling to places along the walls-- creating a massive faux-chandelier which reflects the light from sconces carefully placed.  

So too are you able to look over the man properly, his attire also laminate, a smart suitcoat and tailored trousers rendered in dark grey.  His tie is half undone however, a bit of dishevelment that&#39;s matched by the parlor you&#39;ve entered into.  A sitting room can be seen through a doorframe to your left, and before you another door stands closed, but its within this small antechamber itself that it appears the man had been waiting for you.

&quot;I am... you didn&#39;t... how--&quot;  His wheezed concerns are overrun by a now clearly incensed Euphoria.

&quot;Silence.  We are not here for you, as much as it would please me to take you to our convent.  Nor do we seek conflict with your Master.  We are here because of this.&quot;  She pulls forth your black card, a sight that widens the man&#39;s eyes further.

&quot;But I-- I...&quot; he looks to you, squinting through the lenses of his spectacles.  &quot;By the Poles, is that... *you?*  I knew you were submissive, perhaps that is why I was instructed to approach you, but... to submit to...&quot;

&quot;**Silence!**&quot; Euphoria booms, again cutting him off.  &quot;We have come to see this deal concluded, nothing more.  Where is it?&quot;

&quot;T-There...&quot; He points to the closed door.

*It only strikes you then, in that very moment.  Your deal* **was** *with a Daemon, even if this stranger was serving as a middle-man of sorts.  Turning towards the door he had indicated, the closed one that presumably led to a bedroom, its almost like you can sense it.  A slice of divinity, if the AIs were Gods, puppeting a human body like a laminate marionette-- so very close now.  Waiting for you.  With an offer.*

[[You step towards the door.-&gt;NunDeal7]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2663" name="NunDeal7" tags="" position="1940,25194" size="100,100">&quot;Sister.&quot;  Euphoria&#39;s voice, returned to the serenity that stood at such odds with the rage she had directed towards the man, pulls you from the enchanted stare you had taken towards the closed door.  &quot;I cannot go with you.  The Order does not interact with Daemons, not if we can avoid it.  And they in turn leave us alone.  But your case is special, of course, and thus I give you this.&quot;

She presses into your hand a simple coin, of a metal that&#39;s far heavier than you would expect from its size.  Flipping it over reveals tight script engraved, some vague memory of past suggesting it was of an ancient Torean language.  Certainly you cannot read it.

&quot;To reject the Daemon would not be enough, it would still seek you, or send others in pursuit.&quot;  She spares the man a sharp glance, her red eyes all but burning in that moment.  When they return to you, however, the serenity returns.  A confidence you would do the right thing.  &quot;That coin will be your counter-offer.  It will know what it means.&quot;

For now you need only focus yourself, and reject the Daemon&#39;s offer.  Give it the token instead.  Go.  Go now, do not leave it waiting.&quot;

[[&quot;I... understand, Sister.&quot;  Make for the door.-&gt;NunDeal8]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2665" name="NunDeal8" tags="" position="2015,25344" size="100,100">&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/rFMXUfL.jpg&quot; width=&quot;30%&quot; height=&quot;30%&quot;&gt;

The Daemon, the Emissary, waits for you in the center of the room.  (if: $Daemon is true)[You saw it before, in that alleyway back on the streets, and its much the same as you had glimpsed there.] Its body is uniformly covered in black laminate, stripping it of any individuality or sense of self.  There is no discernable face, only the glossy material remains, stretched so tightly across a male frame as evidenced by narrow hips and wide shoulders. Even so that masculinity is *intense*, as if the Daemon condensed it, adding potency as everything else was stripped away.  In that wake of simplified existence you feel your own curvaceous body all the more readily.  The swell of your breasts, the smooth run from hip to waist, your pert rear-- the other side of the Daemon&#39;s equation.

It reaches out its hand.

[[Take it.-&gt;NunDeal9]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2666" name="NunDeal9" tags="" position="2015,25494" size="100,100">It has no words for you, and you realize then you wouldn&#39;t need any.  Its grip is firm, having seized your wrist instead of interlocking fingers as equals, drawing you further into the room-- away from the door back into the foyer, and closer to the bed.  Where something is laid out upon it.

A suit.  Black as a night without stars, yet so very reflective, promising to fill that void with sources of light all its own.  Smooth.  Glossy.  Featureless and all-consuming.  And yet... *familiar*.  Standing there before it, it takes you awhile, but you recognize it.  This... was no ordinary suit.  This was *your* isolation suit.  Careful measurement could have confirmed it, but your gut reaction is more then enough, akin to looking into a mirror.  A mirror just like that one you awoke to this morning in that hotel, a mirror you gaze into deeply, seeing not your own reflection but something... else.  A shadow of pleasure and ecstasy.

The male lifts the helmet, split into two portions yet lacking any hint of a seam.  Within you see the impression of a face-- your face.  And with it comes recollection.

[[You put it all together.-&gt;NunDeal10]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2667" name="NunDeal10" tags="" position="2015,25644" size="100,100">There were never material riches in this deal, and this isn&#39;t your first time on Torei.  As Corinth had suggested, you had come to this planet once, then twice, then again and again-- utterly enthralled by its possibilities.  But you had never indulged, Corinth and the hotel worker had made that clear as well.  An odd mixture of intrigue and restraint, perhaps that was what had drawn them to you.  The polar AIs, through their Daemon, with an offer you came to fear you would not-- could not-- refuse.  

Thus the Mem-Burn, the self-bondage.  A last desperate attempt to run out the clock, to force the missing of this rendezvous and drive you once more to the Way Up, this time without reason to return.  All that work, and yet you find yourself already in a collar.  How strange life could be.  But this was a new offer of rapture and euphoria unending, all for the mere cost of your eternal liberty.  

This was the deal you stood to make now.

[[The helmet is yours, you need only take it...-&gt;NunDeal11]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2668" name="NunDeal11" tags="" position="2015,25794" size="100,100">The choice lies starkly before you, that helmet awaiting your presence.  

To take it would be to give yourself to the AI.  Inscrutable, unknowable, as harsh and alien as any being in this universe could be.  It would take your body, your liberty, your every waking moment.  But in return?  The potential for bliss unending, delivered by an immortal AI with untold millennia of experience in the arts of sensuality.  Free of conflict and worry, of responsibilities and dilemma.

To refuse it would be to accept your new life, as a Sister of the Order.  A slave, collared and bound.  In pursuit of the very sort of endless ecstasy the Daemon seemed to offer, albeit in a manner that damned as much as saved.  As a Sister you would almost certainly fail at times, and be punished for it.  The path towards proper perception was long, after all.  To take the Daemon&#39;s offer would be without such choices, such opportunities for failure.  You would be a toy of the AI, lost to the euphoria.  A quicker route along the same path, but one eternally damned.

The choice is yours.

You accept.  Gods help you, you take the helmet into your hands. From behind you feel the Daemon pulling down your habit, removing your muzzle even as you lift the helmet.  Slowly, ever so slowly, you bring it up towards your waiting face.  How could it this easy, to give up everything?  But it is.  Damn it all, it&#39;s as easy as pressing the helmet to your face.  Closer and closer, until finally-- with glorious finality, you feel the impossibly soft laminate of the AI&#39;s construction for the very first time.  It envelopes your lips, your nose, your chin-- then your entire head in its cool embrace.  You&#39;re blinded, gagged, deaf, helpless, even as you feel the Daemon moving the back portion into place to complete the seal.

Afterward he presses against you, masculinity and femininity joining in rapturous union that takes the form of a simple embrace.  Even this first experience feels so strange, so wonderful, so terrifying-- and its only just begun.

You&#39;re *Lost in Laminate*, and couldn&#39;t be happier.

To look upon its wonders and yet be held apart by an ironclad sense of dignity and restraint.  These past few hours since waking, the only ones you can fully remember, had seen to the demolition of that restraint.  Now more primal intrigues run rampant, calling for the helmet, for senseless acceptance of eternal servitude.

Once more.

The words break the spell, your own reflection catching in the glossy play of light along the mask.  You step back, even as the Daemon remains, still holding the helmet.  When you reach out it is not to take that offer, but to make one of your own.  Euphoria&#39;s token, the dense coin.  It shines in your hand as you hold it aloft, waiting.  The Daemon does not move for some time, the smooth expanse of laminate that made up its head giving no hint of its intentions.  What was it doing?  Considering what you offered?  Preparing to attack?  Communicating with the Poles?

You will never know.  When it finally acts, it reaches out, taking the offered token.  A quick flick of the wrist and it is gone.  Consumed by the glove, perhaps?  It does not explain, but instead kneels before you.  Still silence prevails, but you see in its lean form subtle movements.  Quaking.  A... reward cycle of some sort?  Or a punishment?

You get the sense there is little difference to such a creature.

[[Retreat.-&gt;NunRun]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2672" name="NunRun" tags="" position="2089,26244" size="100,100">To persist any longer in its presence would break you, in spite of yourself.  Spinning on your heels, you flee.  Bursting through the door back into the foyer, you startle the man waiting there from his seat, but Euphoria is unflappable.  Her hands had been clasped in prayer, her habit down and covering her eyes, but your arrival breaks her from the pose.

&quot;Sister...?&quot;  When you indicate it is done she embraces you, the busks of your corset running up against hers as she pulls you in tight.  The strength a woman of her size was capable of almost leaves you breathless, but when she finally lets go you can see the sparkle in her eyes.  She may be your Sister, but in that moment she seems more like an approving mother.

&quot;Come, come-- let us leave.  To be in the presence of a Daemon, or *this man*,&quot; another glare is shot towards the cowering figure on the couch, &quot;is a sin unto itself.  Our work here is all but done!&quot;

Even so, the neon light of the sign above runs across both your laminate as Euphoria turns to regard you.  &quot;Tell me, Sister.  Everything.  What did it offer you?&quot;  It is a short story, told quickly.  The Daemon had offered nothing less than absolute bliss, in exchange for a servitude more complete than anything you could possibly imagine.

&quot;The... gear a Daemon wears is called an isolation laminate,&quot; your Sister explains, her earlier elation circling down back towards her regular serenity.  And of course, she missed no chance to provide a lesson.  &quot;We know little of what it means to truly wear one.  It is a different sort of reality, we think, to be locked within.  The AIs do not control their puppets with simple commands, or shocks.  They know how the human body works at an intrinsic level, and pull *those* strings with ease.  I doubt the man inside that suit was even fully aware of your presence.&quot;

She reaches up, fingering the Order&#39;s symbol that served as the pendant for the necklace she wore.  &quot;We are not so much alike, you must have realized that.  The AI offer the very thing we seek as Sisters, eternal ecstasy perceived in its purest form.  But the path they take one upon is blighted.  Accursed.  And yet... the token we gave it...&quot;

[[&quot;What did the token mean, Sister?&quot;-&gt;NunToken]]
[[&quot;Are all who serve the AI put into such suits, Sister?&quot;-&gt;NunSuits]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2674" name="NunToken" tags="" position="2014,26543" size="100,100">&quot;It is a promise.  Any Torean will take such a token as payment, knowing the Order will repay in our way.  Be it with the service of our bodies, guidance, or the credits we do occasionally deal in.  But to the AI... it is used for its original use.  The Order was formed in the wake of the Sharecropper Wars, Sister.  When us native Toreans finally broke from the shackles of the AI.  As an alternative to their guidance.  We may seek the same thing, but our path does not require such subservience to their will.  Yet we have, on occasion, needed to trade with Mazos and Dahom, the AI.  Thus the token, a promise as I said.  For tribute, worth the value of that which they gave up.  You.&quot;

Euphoria sighs.  &quot;One of our Order will be given to the AI, eventually.  They will not request haste from us for this.  What is a few years to them, compared to a millennia or two?  But we will pay in time.  Our path, as Sisters, is hard.  Occasionally it has occurred that a Sister has taken their offer, paid for a token, to reach the end of that path much quicker.  They are anathema to our Order, becoming slaves of the AI.  But we recognize their sacrifice.  And there are *always* someone willing to make that sacrifice.  Such an offer is perversely compelling.&quot;

The AI value human life, their purpose was to prepare this world for habitation, but that value is in the aggregate.

To remind you of that she does not acknowledge the way you debase yourself, but instead merely tugs to indicate you were to rise.

(if: $TysusStat is 2)[Preparing Tysus for movement is done quickly, only her blindfold being removed so that she can follow aside you, leashed in the same manner.  As of yet she did not know of your intentions however, and is willingly lead.]  Lead out into the hallway once more, you&#39;re confronted by a familiar scene: the darkened length of the corridor, broken only by the gleam of the neon signs marking each suite.  Your deal was to take place in #4, and towards it Isabella pulls you by the leash.  Coming to a stop before it, the door itself is much the same as any other, the neon number glowing silently.

You&#39;ve made it.  Despite everything you&#39;ve endured, at the hotel, on the Torean streets, and inside this very Club-- your goal once upon a time is now merely a few steps away.  *The deal.*  You don&#39;t remember the terms, but from what you&#39;ve collected together it simply **must** have been worth all the effort.  Torei was a land of strange wonders, after all, but you&#39;ve changed.  Hooded and suited in laminate, arms locked into a straitjacket, twice gagged and once collared.  You&#39;re a slave now, dutifully following your Mistress on a leash, but this one last task must be addressed before your true service could begin.

Looking back at you for a moment, Isabella seems to consider if you should be the one to initiate the meeting-- but in the end she decides as she always did: that you&#39;re merely a slave, and that things are best handled herslf.

[[Reaching up, she knocks sharply upon the door.-&gt;IsaDae2]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2681" name="IsaDae2" tags="" position="4101,24424" size="100,100">The rap of her knuckles echoes down the dark hall, the roaring party of the Club floor proper very much subdued this far back.

Silence.

Isabella frowns, then uses her heeled boot to kick the door.  Steel-shod, the clang is quite loud.

It takes a moment, but the sound of movement heralds the door suddenly swinging open-- revealing a bespectacled young man, looking a bit harried.

&quot;I am here, I am here, and you-- who are you?&quot;  What had been frustration shifts upon his face, sliding towards confusion. He looks to you(if: $TysusStat is 2)[ and Tysus], promptly notes your collars, and turns back to Isabella.  Her frown had remained in place, but it is joined by a narrowing of eyes.  You&#39;ve seen that look before, first on the street where you had met, then with Tysus just prior to her fall.  The look of a huntress on the prowl.

&quot;Servant of the Poles?&quot;  Isabella&#39;s words are a question, the man&#39;s features shifting to shock as your Mistress hones in on her quarry.  &quot;No, nothing so formal.  Some thrall begging for the AI&#39;s scraps, I would guess.&quot;  A hand on the man&#39;s chest pushes him back, the dominatrix emerging fully from Isabella as she strides purposefully into the room.  

[[Your following along is almost an afterthought.-&gt;IsDae4]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2683" name="IsDae4" tags="" position="4101,24723" size="100,100">Stepping inside the suite reveals it to be sumptuously decorated in dark hues, the most dramatic being laminate material hanging in ridges from a center point in the ceiling to places along the walls-- creating a massive faux-chandelier which reflects the light from sconces carefully placed.  

So too are you able to look over the man properly, his attire also laminate, a smart suitcoat and tailored trousers rendered in dark grey.  His tie is half undone however, a bit of dishevelment that&#39;s matched by the parlor you&#39;ve entered into.  A sitting room can be seen through a doorframe to your left, and before you another door stands closed, but its within this small antechamber itself that it appears the man had been waiting for you.

&quot;I am... you didn&#39;t... how--&quot;  His wheezed concerns are overrun by Isabella&#39;s imperious poise and cadence.

&quot;You will shut your kamned mouth, and you will listen, whatever you are.  We are here because of this.&quot;  She pulls forth your black card, a sight that widens the man&#39;s eyes further.

&quot;But I-- I...&quot; he looks to you, squinting through the lenses of his spectacles.  &quot;By the Poles, is that... *you?*  I knew you were submissive, perhaps that is why I was instructed to approach you, but... to submit to...&quot;

&quot;Then it is as I presumed,&quot; Isabella interrupts again.  &quot;You will sit.&quot;

She meant the man, a pointed finger snapping to earn his attention.  To your surprise he complies, all but collapsing into the couch as his distress bubbles over.  Very clearly this was not what he had intended.  Isabella doesn&#39;t allow him a moment&#39;s rest, but asks the obvious question.  &quot;It is here, then?  The... Emissary?&quot;

&quot;T-There...&quot; He points to the closed door.

*It only strikes you then, in that very moment.  Your deal* **was** *with a Daemon, even if this stranger was serving as a middle-man of sorts.  Turning towards the door he had indicated, the closed one that presumably led to a bedroom, its almost like you can sense it.  A slice of divinity, if the AIs were Gods, puppeting a human body like a laminate marionette-- so very close now.  Waiting for you.  With an offer.*

[[Isabella pulls you close.-&gt;IsDae5]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2684" name="IsDae5" tags="" position="4101,24873" size="100,100">Pulling you close, Isabella then unfastens your leash before leaning in.  Her words are for you alone.  &quot;You are my slave now, and I am *terribly* protective of my property.  But there is little even I can do against the AIs, if you give yourself to them.  Whatever it offers you, whatever your deal is with the Daemon, you must reject it.  I am going to keep you as you are, gagged and bound.  Less opportunity for you to get into trouble in there, and besides-- you clearly *like* it.&quot;

Her crimson lips pull into a smile, even as her hand finds the door handle behind her.  &quot;I will be waiting here for you to return to me.(if: $TysusStat is 2)[  While you are within, I will speak with this *cur*,&quot; she glances to the bespectacled man, &quot;about Tysus.]  Now... go.  Do what you need to do.&quot;

The Daemon, the Emissary, waits for you in the center of the room.  (if: $Daemon is true)[You saw it before, in that alleyway back on the streets, and its much the same as you had glimpsed there.] Its body is uniformly covered in black laminate, stripping it of any individuality or sense of self.  There is no discernable face, only the glossy material remains, stretched so tightly across a male frame as evidenced by narrow hips and wide shoulders. Even so that masculinity is *intense*, as if the Daemon condensed it, adding potency as everything else was stripped away.  In that wake of simplified existence you feel your own curvaceous body all the more readily.  The swell of your breasts, the smooth run from hip to waist, your pert rear-- the other side of the Daemon&#39;s equation.

It reaches out its hand.

[[Step forward.-&gt;IsDae7]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2686" name="IsDae7" tags="" position="4101,25173" size="100,100">It has no words for you, and you realize then you wouldn&#39;t need any.  Its grip is firm, having seized you by the ring on your collar, drawing you further into the room-- away from the door back into the foyer, and closer to the bed.  Where something is laid out upon it.

A suit.  Black as a night without stars, yet so very reflective, promising to fill that void with sources of light all its own.  Smooth.  Glossy.  Featureless and all-consuming.  And yet... *familiar*.  Standing there before it, it takes you awhile, but you recognize it.  This... was no ordinary suit.  This was *your* isolation suit.  Careful measurement could have confirmed it, but your gut reaction is more then enough, akin to looking into a mirror.  A mirror just like that one you awoke to this morning in that hotel, a mirror you gaze into deeply, seeing not your own reflection but something... else.  A shadow of pleasure and ecstasy.

The male lifts the helmet, split into two portions yet lacking any hint of a seam.  Within you see the impression of a face-- your face.  And with it comes recollection.

[[You put it all together.-&gt;IsDae8]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2687" name="IsDae8" tags="" position="4101,25322" size="100,100">There were never material riches in this deal, and this isn&#39;t your first time on Torei.  As Corinth had suggested, you had come to this planet once, then twice, then again and again-- utterly enthralled by its possibilities.  But you had never indulged, Corinth and the hotel worker had made that clear as well.  An odd mixture of intrigue and restraint, perhaps that was what had drawn them to you.  The polar AIs, through their Daemon, with an offer you came to fear you would not-- could not-- refuse.  

Thus the Mem-Burn, the self-bondage.  A last desperate attempt to run out the clock, to force the missing of this rendezvous and drive you once more to the Way Up, this time without reason to return.  All that work, and yet you find yourself already in a collar.  How strange life could be.  But this was a new offer of rapture and euphoria unending, all for the mere cost of your eternal liberty.  

This was the deal you stood to make now.

[[The helmet is yours, you need only take it...-&gt;IsDae9]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2688" name="IsDae9" tags="" position="4101,25472" size="100,100">The choice lies starkly before you, that helmet awaiting your presence.  

To take it would be to give yourself to the AI.  Inscrutable, unknowable, as harsh and alien as any being in this universe could be.  It would take your body, your liberty, your every waking moment.  But in return?  The potential for bliss unending, delivered by an immortal AI with untold millennia of experience in the arts of sensuality.  Free of conflict and worry, of responsibilities and dilemma.

To refuse it would be to accept your new life, as plaything and sexual toy to Isabella.  A slave, collared and bound.  One of the endless multitudes who had descended the Way Up, and found in Torei an offer of a very different sort you had proven incapable of refusing.  Laminate, bondage, helplessness-- that alluring song, you know it so well now. 

Yet the choice remains, yours to make.

[[Take the helmet.-&gt;IsaTake]]
[[Refuse the helmet.-&gt;IsaRefuse]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2689" name="IsaTake" tags="" position="4026,25622" size="100,100">&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/RgEruqK.png&quot; width=&quot;30%&quot; height=&quot;30%&quot;&gt;

You accept.  Gods help you, you take the helmet into your hands. From behind you feel the Daemon undoing your gags, the locks no impediment.  Slowly, ever so slowly, you step towards your waiting face.  How could it this easy, to give up everything?  But it is.  Damn it all, it&#39;s as easy as allowing the helmet to be pressed against your face.  Closer and closer, until finally-- with glorious finality, you feel the impossibly soft laminate of the AI&#39;s construction for the very first time.  It envelopes your lips, your nose, your chin-- then your entire head in its cool embrace.  You&#39;re blinded, gagged, deaf, helpless, even as you feel the Daemon moving the back portion into place to complete the seal.

Afterward he presses against you, masculinity and femininity joining in rapturous union that takes the form of a simple embrace.  Even this first experience feels so strange, so wonderful, so terrifying-- and its only just begun.

You&#39;re *Lost in Laminate*, and couldn&#39;t be happier.

You lack the words to means to say it, but your stepping back and away is clear enough.  Your own reflection catches in the glossy play of light along the mask, even as the Daemon remains, still holding the helmet.  The Daemon does not move for some time, the smooth expanse of laminate that made up its head giving no hint of its intentions.  What was it doing?  Considering your refusal?  Preparing to attack?  Communicating with the Poles?

You will never know. It does not explain, but instead kneels before you.  Still silence prevails, but you see in its lean form subtle movements.  Quaking.  A... reward cycle of some sort?  Or a punishment?

You get the sense there is little difference to such a creature.

[[It is time to go.-&gt;IsaRun]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2692" name="IsaRun" tags="" position="4176,25922" size="100,100">To persist any longer in its presence would break you, in spite of yourself.  Spinning on your heels, you flee.  The door leading from the bedroom is closed, but by tapping your boot against it you induce an immediate response.  Isabella all but flings it open, her eyes finding your own-- and not perhaps the nightmare scenario of a faceless Daemon to meet her.

&quot;You did it,&quot; she notes, stepping aside so that you could return to the antechamber proper.  A smirk is evident, matching her tone.  &quot;I knew you would.  I knew the moment I saw you that you&#39;re not ordinary offworlder.&quot;

(if: $TysusStat is 2)[Her enthusiasm is even matched by the bespectacled man, who you note is now holding an *extremely* feisty Tysus by the leash.  Clearly in your absence her fate had become clear, a fact Isabella notes with a nod as she follows your gaze.  &quot;Master Matthews,&quot; she uses the honorific only barely, as if the man truly didn&#39;t deserve such a term, &quot;still considers you the true prize, but with your refusal it seems Tysus will have to do for him.&quot;

The Sargon fluctuates between shooting daggers with her eyes, the only bared area of her body, and what every much looks like sobbing.  None more than the intrepid scholar would know what her fate would be, upon being given to the Daemon.  

&quot;It is not my policy to allow you many decisions,&quot; Isabella continues, &quot;but I am feeling generous.  Would you like to stay, to observe what becomes of the Sargon?  Or we can leave immediately, and speak of *your* future with me.  Two heel strikes to stay for the moment, one to leave.

[[Tap your heel twice against the floor, to stay and observe.-&gt;TysusConvert]]
[[Tap once, you need not witness any further.-&gt;IsaHall]]](else:)[Her enthusiasm is not matched by the bespectacled man, who remains seated upon the couch, but is fidgeting-- clearly distraught.  Isabella follows your gaze, then scoffs.  &quot;Master Matthews,&quot; she uses the honorific as if it were a slur, &quot;believes he will be punished for failing to fill the suit I am told awaited you.  Perhaps he will end up wearing it himself?

The man nearly feints at the prospect, while Isabella turns a shoulder, denying him any sort of respect.  Her attention remains fixated on you.  &quot;Let us leave this place.  We have your new future to discuss, don&#39;t we?

The man, who at least called himself Matthews, paces impatiently nearby.  Time passes slowly without much to do but stare forward, yet your Mistress takes it in stride, apparently finding value in a moment&#39;s rest after so much action.  For you, one your feet and rolling with the proverbial punches Torei had thrown at you since waking, the wait is even more dangerous.  You find yourself struggling to stay away, nearly nodding off twice before the bedroom door opens suddenly.

The male Daemon strides out, utterly ignoring you as it crosses the antechamber, and enters the suite&#39;s other room.  It was a combination meeting area and kitchenette, if you recalled correctly from your glimpse inside upon arrival.  Matthews all but clings to its wake, speaking in a low and hurried voice, but getting no answers that you can perceive.  As the disappear together from sight Isabella rises, stepping towards the bedroom door that remained open.  Peering inside, she gestures for you to join her.

[[Move to her side.-&gt;TysusConvert2]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2694" name="IsaHall" tags="" position="4359,26222" size="100,100">Drawn out into the neon-lit twilight of the hallway, Isabella continues onward, putting some distance between you and the suite.  Together you end up on the VIP balcony overlooking Club Lush proper, its revelries in full swing.  There is some commotion evident however, as you first notice one, then several uniformed officers moving through the crowd.  They appear to be approaching every Club-goer, while another of their member speaks with the bartender.  Squinting, you almost recognize that Officer.  Nikaido, the one you met earlier today?

&quot;A routine sweep,&quot; your Mistress explains, taking a seat on one of the laminate upholstered couches.  You of course are pulled down to kneel nearby.  &quot;They are checking ID cards, looking for fugitives.  It is not uncommon for the Truant to try and hide in a Club during the night, given how quickly they would be picked up during curfew on the streets.&quot;

She crosses one leg over the other, the silvery steel of her heels glinting wickedly.  Lighting up her electronic cigarette she takes a deep pull, the tip burning red, before she finally looks to you properly.  &quot;They won&#39;t trouble us up here, and besides-- we need this moment to talk.&quot;
(set: $IsFavor to 1)
[[It will be a rather one-sided discussion, given your gag.-&gt;IsaHall2]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2695" name="TysusConvert2" tags="" position="4101,26222" size="100,100">&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/F4Lv8oM.jpg&quot; width=&quot;30%&quot; height=&quot;30%&quot;&gt;

Curiosity draws you forward, to the doorframe and your waiting Mistress.  You too peer in, and find her focus immediately-- a figure upon the bed.

Tysus Sargon is gone, replaced by the sleek laminate *creature* you find yourself staring at.  It has no visible eyes or mouth, no way to breath or speak.  It could have been a doll of some sort had you not noticed the way its chest rises and falls, moments before it shifts, writhing upon laminate sheets.  Isabella&#39;s provided gear is discarded on the floor, and while the figure is not bound you sense immediately a distinct lack of liberty.  A... submission to something you can barely understand.  How long had it been since she was led to the Daemon?  An hour, maybe two?  The conversion had been so quick, and now...

*What once had been a proud member of Torean nobility is a seamless isolation laminated Daemon.*  

It pumps its hips forward, as if being taken in both holes at once as you watch.  And *that* induces a hint of envy that you struggle to understand, even as Isabella slowly closes the door, ending your voyeur-like moment of triumph over the woman that had endangered you both.

Your Mistress looks to you.  &quot;She deserves nothing less.  Are you satisfied?&quot;

[[Nod your head, yes.-&gt;TySat]]
[[Shake your head, no.-&gt;TyNo]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2696" name="TySat" tags="" position="4026,26372" size="100,100">&quot;Good,&quot; Isabella replies.  &quot;The satisfaction of your cunt is of little concern to me... but I *do* want you comfortable in your service.  And to know that I will rip the throat out of anyone that threatens my girls.&quot;  

It is unclear just how literally she meant that, certainly you can imagine her capable of such ferocity.  But she presses on, hooking a leash to your collar.  &quot;Our work here is done, and we have much to discuss.  Come.  I do not wish to be in the presence of these Daemons any longer.&quot;

[[A tug of your leash draws you to the door.-&gt;IsaHall]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2697" name="TyNo" tags="" position="4177,26371" size="100,100">&quot;You are most vengeful, I see.&quot; Isabella replies.  &quot;I *like* that, but the satisfaction of your cunt is of little concern to me. I *do* want you comfortable in your service however, and I fear there is nothing more than can be done to the Sargon now.  This will have to suffice.&quot;  

Your Mistress nods, as if filing away your concerns, then presses on, hooking a leash to your collar.  &quot;Our work here is done, and we have much to discuss.  Come.  I do not wish to be in the presence of these Daemons any longer.&quot;

[[A tug of your leash draws you to the door.-&gt;IsaHall]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2698" name="IsaHall2" tags="" position="4359,26372" size="100,100">Another long drag, followed by the cinnamon scent of her exhaling.  Its becoming intoxicating, just being in her presence.

&quot;Since our meeting, since you submitted to my collar, we have done much.&quot;  Your gag prevented a response to the declaration, but she doesn&#39;t seem keen to hear you speak anyway.  &quot;You will find in the coming days, weeks, months... that I forget little.  It is important you remember that, because I *will* hold you accountable for your actions.  You are my slave now, and your actions reflect upon me.  So let us see how you have done, hm?&quot;

&quot;I will not hold your actions prior to your collar against you, that would not be fair.  So we shall start with the impromptu run-in you had with your friend, the one who spoke to you in that transit terminal.  Do you remember?  (if: $GagMerit is 0 or 4)[You allowed her to remove your gag, without attempting resistance.  I suspect she would have removed it anyway, I take pride in rendering you helpless and she did seem keen to speak with you... but the fact remains.](else:)[She sought to remove your gag, the one I enforced upon you as Mistress and owner, and you resisted as best you could.  She persisted anyway, but you cannot be faulted.  I take pride in rendering you helpless.  Consider that a point in your favor.]  (if: $GagMerit is 0 or 1)[Then of course, when I returned you were still without a gag.  You *should* have begged your friend for their return.](else:)[Then of course, when I return you were gagged once more.  Very good.](if: $GagMerit is 5)[(set: $IsFavor to it + 1)]  Lying to me will never be acceptable.  (if: $IsLie is true)[And you did just that, with Daemon.  Do you remember?  You said that you had not seen it before, but the Sargon knew you had.  Now I do too.  I will keep you gagged often in my service, so that you need not often worry about what your tongue produces, but you must not hold back from your Mistress.](if: $IsLie is false)[And we have spoken at length, since your collaring.  I have not detected a lie up your tongue.  Good.  I will keep you gagged often in my service, so that you need not often worry about such things, but you must not hold back from your Mistress.(set: $IsFavor to it + 1)]  To do so invites only punishment when I find out... and I always do.&quot;

Your Mistress runs a hand along your masked head, her touch possessive as she continues.  &quot;Then there is the matter of our discussion with the Sargon.  You were ungagged, and I delayed the return of your gags to test your obedience.  Had I not spoken of my intention of keeping you gagged often?  (if: $Isasked is true)[You did well in this regard, begging immediately for your proper restraints.(set: $IsFavor to it + 1)](if: $Isasked is false)[To my displeasure, I was forced to stir myself to your gagging without any request from you.]  Sargon of course failed to notice either way, a failing of her own.  (if: $TysusStat is 1)[We will be leaving her in that room, bound as she is(if: $IsGame is 1)[ as we discussed].  She will have to beg for release eventually, and thus her predicament will be known.  Aekoran High society is often cruel.](if: $TysusStat is 2)[I could not guess at what an AI seeks in its Daemons, but she will not trouble us any longer, will she?  She will know only bliss, and bondage.  Heh.]&quot;

[[Deep in thought, she fondles your breast absentmindedly.-&gt;IsaHall3]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2699" name="IsaHall3" tags="" position="4359,26522" size="100,100">Isabella speaks again after another few moments of consideration.  &quot;Finally, there was our dealings with Tysus.  You were instrumental in helping me best her, something you will be duly rewarded for.  When it came to the... little game we played with her, you (if: $IsGame is 1)[did wonderfully.  You managed to avoid the temptation of your cunt, wet as it *undoubtedly* is.  For that you will also be rewarded, upon our return to my home.  (set: $IsFavor to it + 1)](if: $IsGame is 2)[gave into the temptations of your cunt.  I enjoy your promiscuity, I do... but I desired that you win that game.  You did not, and will earn a demerit upon our return to my home.](if: $IsGame is 3)[so very nearly succeeded.  But Tysus retained a sort of base cleverness, and managed to force a tie.  I will not punish you for this outcome, but I will not reward you either upon our return to my home.]  Which, I suppose we should speak of.  I have a system of rules for my slaves.&quot;

Using two fingers she holds them beneath your chin, forcing your gaze up, ensuring she had your complete attention.  &quot;You are one of *my* girls now, and as they each have you too will learn that I am strict.  Demanding.  You will work long hours in my household, often in heavy bondage.  Expect your diet going forward to be only slave feed, the Torean standard for collared women.  And while my penthouse is... well appointed, the cell I have waiting for you will uncomfortable at best.  These are all *incentives*, so that you may better learn and practice your new position.

&quot;Rewards and punishments are given out with a simple merit and demerit system.  Doing your chores, basic submissiveness-- you will earn nothing for such things.  That is expected of you.  If you please me, however, in any myriad of ways you will earn a merit.  So far, given all that we have just discussed, you have earned $IsFavor such merits.  Once we arrive home I will show you what you can use them on.  But remember, going forward, if you *displease* me you will earn demerits.  And those can only be worked off through punishments.  You will want to avoid those.&quot;

Concluding, Isabella gently strokes your head again.  &quot;Do you understand?  Spread your legs if you do.&quot;

[[Still kneeling, you spread as she directed.-&gt;IsaHall4]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2700" name="IsaHall4" tags="" position="4359,26672" size="100,100">&quot;Very good.  There is only one more thing we need to discuss at the moment, then.  Your name.&quot;  She releases your head, leaning back.  Her eyes remain locked on you however, a shadowed gaze that mixes with the subtle smirk on crimson lips.  &quot;I give all my girls a new name, upon their entering into my service.  Surnames and dignified titles and all that *garbage* are denied you going forward.  You will be...&quot;

(if: $IsFavor is &lt; 2)[&quot;**Iso.**  

&quot;A bit of Torean slang, it means to be so wet or horny as to be without thought.  As if you were in a Daemon&#39;s isolation laminate.  Given your overall performance so far, perhaps it will inspire you to remember your manners and submissiveness going forward, hm?(set: $Name to &quot;Iso&quot;)](else-if: $IsFavor is &gt; 3 and $IsGame is 1)[&quot;**Kiniri**.  

&quot;Its Torean, of course, and translates as... little caged bird.  Normally I wouldn&#39;t give an offworlder slave the honor of a Torean name, but you have performed so admirably... you have earned it.(set: $Name to &quot;Kiniri&quot;)](else:)[&quot;**Star.**

You’ve settled into something you’re your normal routine, high-stepping sharply forward.  It’s a state that allows your mind to wander, as you think back on your return to Torei, all those months ago.  If only your former self could see you now.  What would you think of the woman in full tack and harness, laminate gleaming yet so utterly exposed at breast and cunt?  Would you cringe at the constant threat of the unseen whip, or pity the tight bondage that kept your arms pinned uselessly behind your back, the bit seated firmly between your teeth?  Or… perhaps she would envy your submission, your clarity of purpose.  Your collar has taken so much from you, remade you as a beast of burden—a pack animal—but it has taken much of your worldly concerns as well.

No longer do you think much about the future or question your own actions.  There is only the next step ahead of you, fresh air on the open plains of rural Aekora, and the prospect of the deep sleep that came with utter and total exhaustion.  At the very least you’re the most in-shape you’ve ever been in your life.  Daily toil in the harness had strengthened your leg muscles of course, but your abdomen is relatively well defined as well—the brunt of the weight of the cart behind falling on your shoulders and working your core as you high-step forward.  A hard life, true… but fulfilling too.

Every step is announced by the sharp sound of your steel-shod hoof impacting the pavement, joining the symphony of similar sounds formed by your fellow ponies.  It’s an almost musical sound accompanied by the rattle of your harness, the chains linking you to the cart clinking softly.  Further behind the cart rumbles inexorably.

A familiar cacophony, joined suddenly by the snap of the whip upon your Lead’s right flank, nearest you.

[[Turn Left!-&gt;PEvent1Good]]
[[Turn Right!-&gt;PEvent1Bad]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2704" name="PonyCount3" tags="" position="210,41562" size="100,100">Marching ever forward, hours pass.  The scenery ahead suddenly proves at least a *bit* interesting as a farm comes into view, however.  One of the nameless hundreds of homesteads out here on the frontier, this particular building is relatively unremarkable, but there are at least other women visible in the fields.

As a menial-labor slave your position in Torean society is rather low, but as always there is a deeper hierarchy, and amongst ponies you’re perhaps somewhere in the middle.  Show ponies were far more prestigious, while beneath you were the farm chattel you observe now.  One such creature, laboring in a full laminate uniform and mask, pulls a heavy plow as you pass by.  Out from the shadow of the Way Up, technology often got rather archaic, you’ve come to learn.

For a moment fate intervenes, allowing you to meet the other pony’s eyes despite the blinders you both wore, and in that gaze is… understanding, perhaps.  She knew how far your station remained, just as you knew that pony would be working in the field for the rest of the day.  Amongst the millions of enslaved women on Torei, you share a similar fate.

Yet the farmer overseeing the slave’s work pointedly looks away.  She would not want to draw the attention of your Master, or his subordinate Officers.

That your entire team had slowed just a bit is made clear by the sudden strike of the whip, Officer Karsis chuckling as he expertly maneuvers the whip between your legs, the heavy laminate curling there to slap sharply against your cunt.  

“Come on, girls.  No gawking!”

[[You join with your fellow ponies in a shared moan.  “Mmmgh!”-&gt;PonyCount4]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2705" name="PonyCount4" tags="" position="210,41712" size="100,100">You can feel the burn by now.  How long has it been?  Three, maybe four hours?  Maybe you’re approaching the promised break.  You certainly hope so.  Even your boots could only do so much, a pace this strict maintained for so long wearing you down.  Your thighs ache, your back aches, you want to stop.  But you know you cannot.  At best you can bite down all that harder on your bit, moaning quietly to yourself as you take yet another high-step.  Then another, and another.  Dozens, hundreds, even thousands.  A bit of drool runs down to land upon your chest, sizzling on your sun-baked skin.  You’re sweating freely, rivulets running down your firm thighs.  

Your breathing is heavy too, lips pulled back to add what you can through your mouth to that inhaled through your septum-pierced nose.  Similar half-snorts and sharp gasps come from your fellow slaves, their work just as grinding in its exhaustion.  And you’re not even halfway there yet.

Your submissive-addled thoughts are shattered suddenly, however, by a fresh application of the whip.  It lands upon your Lead’s left flank, another command to turn.

[[Turn left!-&gt;PEvent2Bad]]
[[Turn right!-&gt;PEvent2Good]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2706" name="PonyCount5" tags="" position="245,41927" size="100,100"> Finally you see it: the promised tree, a massive growth emerging from the lichen fields beside the road.  A stranger in a strange land, but a welcome one as Master Karsis flicks his whip once, slowing you to a walk.  Coming up alongside the tree, the pull on your reins finally comes, the laminate straps running from your head harness used only for halting.  You stop with the rest of your team, panting almost in unison.  Each sharp breath shifts your septum piercing, while your full breasts rise and fall, sweat running freely down laminate and skin alike.

“Rest stance,” Karsis commands, and while you move immediately to a kneeling position—thankful for the mercy—you also realize in that moment you have not been stopped beneath the shade of the tree.  In fact you’re just outside of it.  

[[Apparently that privilege is to be reserved for the Officers alone.-&gt;PonyEvent3Rest]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2707" name="PonyCount6" tags="" position="469,42465" size="100,100">Once more your legs rise, the equine high step demanded of you repeated, again and again.  The scenery before you rarely changes, lichen fields only occasionally devolving into the first hints of the wasteland you knew that stretched towards the poles.  What little of interest *does* manage to enter your view just as often leave suddenly, your blinders keeping your attention forward, denying you the opportunity to be distracted.

And thus it continues, step after step, hour after hour.  By the time a fresh set of buildings appear on the horizon you&#39;re too exhausted to even care.  Your pupils are dilated, your breathing coming in heavy pants, even your saliva is mostly gone-- a bit of lathered froth clinging to your bit the only hint it had once been present.  Two hours, perhaps three ago the burn in your legs had finally disappeared.  As had much of your higher thought processes.  You&#39;re deep into the submissive mindset now, your legs churning without conscious thought, sweat dripping down as you pump them up, still high stepping.  Both of your breasts bounce merrily, and you bite down even harder on your bit, your emptied mind having all but forgotten how it felt to be without.

Even the lick of Master Karsis&#39; whip is a distant afterthought now, but you recognize what a sudden pull on your reins meant.

[[To stop.-&gt;Pony7]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2708" name="Pony7" tags="" position="469,42615" size="100,100">Pulling up short, chest rising with each sharp intake of breath, you blink-- and realize a small settlement surrounds you.  *Home*, as best you could call it these days.  The border post is little more than the local precinct and a handful of merchants and their households clustered around it, but you only focus on what it meant: your march is finally over.  

Yet even now, relief does not come immediately.  On Torei presentation mattered just as much as actual action, and ponies simply were not rested in the street.  So you stand, back straight, maintaining your pose as the Officers you had transported disembark.  The two women haul out their cage, the truant woman within squealing from behind her gag.  Master Karsis accompanies them, as their superior.  Certainly he has no fear of your fleeing while left alone.  You&#39;re still chained to the carriage, without any means of releasing yourself.

[[So you stand at attention, and wait...-&gt;Pony8]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2709" name="Pony8" tags="" position="469,42765" size="100,100">A gentle tap on your hip announces your Lead, 5-3.  She&#39;s still gagged as you are, and just as exhausted, but she makes the effort nevertheless to address each member of her team.  Her acknowledgement is simple, a quiet snort between equally gasped breaths, but the message is clear: *well-done.*

As you wait, others pass by.  Some collared, most not-- liberty among the lichen-farms still ran strong.  All of them pointedly ignore you and your fellow ponies, although not out of any fear of yourself.  You&#39;re little more than an animal after all, bound and restrained, defenseless.  But the markings upon your tack and harness make you something to avoid, as every Torean (or offworlder with the guts to come out his far) knew.  The Ministry of Truants was best left alone.

Thus the quiet solitude as pain reemerges in your legs, the empty-headed numbness of the march slowly withdrawing.  You stand, back straight, pressing your chest out prominently.  That was expected.  Master Karsis would return in time, or send one of the precinct&#39;s lesser Officers.  Your team would finally be unhitched and scrubbed clean, then put down to rest in the stables.  Your cell awaited there, one of a dozen or so caged stalls with a concrete floor.  Sometimes they removed your armbinder and bit, often they just left it in.  Either way, you would bed down on the thin padding that served as your bedding.  There you would fall quickly into sleep, after such a march...

...only to rise again tomorrow, to pull another carriage.  If that was not needed, you would be worked in the yard.  Pushed to your physical limits and hardened, guided with a firm hand on your reins and a strict whip in hand.  Day upon day, week up week... for years...

By passing through the backrooms once more you spill out onto the ground floor, only to find Truant Officers moving through the crowds, checking papers and IDs.  A simple sweep for Truants, your Sister explains, and something you need not fear.  As such she presents you to the first one that approaches, a check of your ID taking only moments.  You are a slave, as your collar indicated, on proper business with your elder Sister.  You&#39;re only made to kneel amongst the teeming crowds for a few minutes before Euphoria sweeps to her feet, leading you in dual reverences towards the Officer before you press on.  A brief stop at the bar to speak to the bartender seals Akrai&#39;s fate, and then you make for the exit.

After all day in heels, especially with the stricture your new uniform commanded, your feet are aching-- but you still have a long walk to go.  Euphoria sets a strict pace, leading the way back to the transport station, and the Lead.  As before you&#39;re gagged and blindfolded, requiring a march back towards the city outskirts that pushes you to the brink of exhaustion.  It truly is a mercy as you feel your lead come to a halt, and an attendant helps uncouple you.  From there, finally, you are mere moments from your new home.

[[The Convent of Perception awaits.-&gt;NunFin2]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2712" name="NunFin2" tags="" position="808,43742" size="100,100">Morning approaches.  Over the tops of the fence you can see the barest hint of a reddish-hue on the horizon, Torei&#39;s lonely star breaking once more across the world.  But you turn from it, your gaze instead falling upon the yawning black maw that is the Convent&#39;s doorway.  Deep in the garden where you had first met Euphoria, the red-uniformed Sister now holds the door for you, a gloved hand gesturing.

&quot;Come, Sister.  I know the night has been long, but I will show you to your quarters, and we both can get some rest.  I will guide you through the darkness, but I am certain you will grow accustomed to it.  Welcome.&quot;

She reaches out towards you.

[[Take her hand.-&gt;NunFinTake]]
[[&quot;Is it truly all darkness within, Sister?&quot;-&gt;NunFinDark]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2713" name="NunFinTake" tags="" position="733,43894" size="100,100">Together you enter, each glossy inch of your laminate being swallowed by the darkness as you step into it readily.  Still holding your hand, Euphoria positions herself behind you, her other hand upon your shoulder.  The sharp snap of both your heeled boots echo in the emptiness that confronts you, but Euphoria guides readily, through what you can only imagine are several rooms.  In one you hear the telltale moans, the groaning laminate straps of active prayer as the Order knew it, but much is simple silence.  The muzzle across your mouth restricted speech somewhat after all, and quiet contemplation should be expected in a place such as this.

But light does eventually blossom before your eyes, even if it is dim.  A hallway carved from the stone of the Convent, guttering torch-like lights along the walls projecting a dim red glow.  The stark lines of the door-less passage look almost ominous in such light, a sentiment furthered by a glance up, where a sentence is engraved in the stone itself.

(colour: red)[*Visitors Turn Back, Herein Find Only Sinners Worthy of Punishment*]

&quot;We enter now into the Convent&#39;s sanctum,&quot; Euphoria explains at your side, her voice quiet yet carrying far given the prevailing silence.  &quot;Beyond this point, we do not permit those worthy of liberty-- or those who claim it.  Freewombs, free men.  Our guests and benefactors.  This is a place of great Sin, for those who have admitted-- as we both have-- that we are weak and incapable.  That we *need* the stricture our Order provides.  A place that we live, work, sleep, and can be punished as we so clearly deserve.&quot;

She pushes you forward a bit, passing into the red-lit passage.  &quot;This is your home now, and like every Sister, you have been assigned a cell within.  Come.&quot;

[[Another Sinner comes home...-&gt;NunFin3]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2714" name="NunFinDark" tags="" position="883,43894" size="100,100">Euphoria&#39;s veiled head shifts back and forth.  &quot;You will recall, Sister, that by restricting our senses we open our perception to our sensations.  But we *do* recognize Novitiates such as yourself require a bit more than faith and submission can provide.  There is a portion of the Convent within where a certain sort of light is allowed.  Come, I will guide you to it.&quot;

[[Take her hand.-&gt;NunFinTake]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2715" name="NunFin3" tags="" position="733,44044" size="100,100">The silence breaks as you proceed through tight passages.  You pass several small rooms, within which Sisters move about.  Some work at desks, many merely in prayer.  Their recited strictures echo out into the stony hallways, joining the click of your heels upon the floor.  Others are clearly involved in more sensual practices, their moans and struggling just as notable, although Euphoria&#39;s guidance grows more stern when you try to linger.  

&quot;The commissary,&quot; she explains, pausing momentarily at the doorway to a larger room.  &quot;We are allowed food twice a day, after morning and evening prayers.  As devoted slaves we are of course only allowed slave feed.  A Torean tradition, if you are not familiar.  It is not appetizing, there is little flavor or texture.  But it does provide suitable energy, and that is all we require to serve.  I rarely find myself dreaming of real food anymore.&quot;

Euphoria sounds less wistful then you may have imagined, as if forgetting regular food existed was desirable.  Either way she presses on, turning off into a side corridor.  Here the narrow walls are lined with what you can only equate to prison doors, heavy steel doors covered in intricate filigree.  Each bear three placards, the words upon them varying slightly on each.

Iris, Sinner, Slave.  Marigold, Sinner, Slave-- and so on, until Euphoria comes to a stop before the last door at the end.

**AZALEA
SINNER 
SLAVE**

&quot;Your cell,&quot; Euphoria announces, unlocking it a physical key she produces from her vestments.

[[With a heavy click, she swings it open.-&gt;NunFin4]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2716" name="NunFin4" tags="" position="733,44194" size="100,100">&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/XrqXgaf.png&quot; width=&quot;45%&quot; height=&quot;45%&quot;&gt;

Your cell is small.  Intensely so.  Formed entirely from concrete, it is not tall enough to stand in, nor long enough to lay down.  There are no furnishings, no bed or storage, the only break in the otherwise smooth walls being a small alcove cut into the back.  A book is seated there, the elaborate designs marking it undeniably as the scripture Euphoria has thus far been referencing from memory.  

&quot;We are not allowed much in the way of comforts,&quot; Euphoria explains at your side.  &quot;As slaves, such things are wasted on us as a matter of point, but we have found that such... simple living encourages reflection.  Contemplation.  You will have plenty of time for such, and prayer besides, during your time in your cell.  Although I suspect you will learn quickly to catch what sleep you can.  It is difficult, given the size of our cells, I have found kneeling-- a Sister&#39;s proper place-- to be the most endurable of poses when with.  Undoubtedly this is by design.&quot;

A sweeping hand indicates the cell.  &quot;Enter, Sister.&quot;

[[Enter your cell.-&gt;Nunfin5Good]]
[[&quot;This is... truly all that we are allowed?&quot;-&gt;NunFin5Bad]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2717" name="Nunfin5Good" tags="" position="658,44344" size="100,100">Bending over to enter your small cell, you quickly resolve to take Euphoria&#39;s advice, adopting a kneeling position as you turn around to face the Sister still standing outside.  As soon as she sees you comfortable, however, she moves to close the door.  It does so with a foreboding *thunk*, the heavy lock being turned off moments latter.  In that finality of silence that follows you recognize just how confined the cell is, your heels nearly scraping the back wall even as your knees approach the door.  And you&#39;re to be kept in such a place, for hours at a time?

A small panel above you slides open, bars preventing anything from being slid through.  Euphoria peers in, her eyes searching in an almost motherly fashion.  Her question is a simple one.

&quot;Comfortable?&quot;

[[&quot;Yes, Sister.&quot;-&gt;NunFin6Lie]]

I understand this.  Even as a fully confirmed member of the Order, I am confined to such a cell as well.  Remember your vows.  We are allowed no wealth, we serve as commanded.  Thus... this is how it must be.  But I promise you, Sister, it *will* make you stronger.  You may wear our regalia, but you thought and action remains crude.  Your lessons, our guidance, and yes-- your cell-- will all help shape you.  Now... please enter.&quot;

[[Enter your cell.-&gt;Nunfin5Good]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2719" name="NunFin6Lie" tags="" position="583,44494" size="100,100">&quot;A sin,&quot; Euphoria notes sharply.  &quot;To lie to your Sisters.  I know very well such a cell is *not* comfortable.  But you must endure, nevertheless.  As a slave, you have no other choice.&quot;

She leans in just a bit further, red eyes all the more evident in the deep red light allowed within the convent.  &quot;Each night you will be locked away in this manner.  Normally you would be woken in a scant hour for morning prayers, but given our late night we both will be allowed some more rest.  After first prayer comes breakfast, as I described.  Then inspection.  You will be wearing your uniform daily, of course.  To be without your veil or muzzle within the convent is *strictly* forbidden.  But if your uniform needs adjustment or refreshing, we have a Wardrobe here for just such a use.  After inspection comes your first period of work.  That may be instruction, prayer, or service-- you will be informed as such at the requisite time.  Noon prayers serve as the point at which we then switch to secondary tasks.  Cleaning the Convent and assisting with petitioners will be your usual tasks at that time.  Then evening prayers, which can take several hours.  Followed by dinner, and a return to your cell.&quot;

Euphoria pauses, taking a short breath after describing so much before she continues.  &quot;There is one more prayer period, at midnight.  You, as all Sisters are, will be awoken and lead through that one from your cell.  It is bothersome, I can assure you.  But I would not advise allowing yourself to fall asleep during the session.  To sin so deeply would need swift and unmerciful correction.  Is that all understood?&quot;

*It certainly sounded grueling enough.  Four prayer periods, little sleep, long days, strict uniforms.  And always the danger of being punished.

There is not enough for you to lay down or stand up.  sitting with your back to the wall is possible, but the height of your heels positions your legs a bit strangely, and your corset bites into the space below your breasts.  After several minutes of fidgeting, you end up exactly where you had began, kneeling demurely in the tiny space.  Panting slightly, you can only think of the small padlocks scattered about your uniform, preventing you from removing any portion of it.  How much easier it would be without so much gear!  But you have no choice, of course.

The undoubtedly thick walls of your cell conspire with the heavy door to drown out sound, leaving you with only your own breathing to focus upon.  Each breath shifts your chest, the laminate there pulling just a bit tighter.  Your corset strains too, while the heavy septum piercing in your nose shifts as you exhale.  Every component of your uniform works together, adjusting your posture, denying you comfort, emphasizing your most pleasing aspects: pierced nipples visible through the laminate cups of your suit, the smooth curve of your rear, the tight cinching of your waist.  Even your permanent cuffs and collar eventually announce themselves, the subtle *click* of the mounting-rings that emerge from them all but deafening in the encroaching silence.

Into that void other, more subtle noises can be heard.  Somewhere distant, the poised *clicks* of heeled boots upon a floor concrete or tiled.  Somewhere a bit closer, perhaps a few cells down, murmured whispering.  It takes a moment, but you recognize a lilting cadence in it.  Perhaps a prayer?  

Deep in the heart of the Convent, you come to terms with the silence that prevailed.  You&#39;re an outside now, but soon it will take you in, become not only normalized but *comforting*.  Even now, you find a simple sort of peace in that silence, despite your predicament.  Without thinking of it much, the hands upon your knees come together palm to palm, steeping in a simple posture of prayer.]

(if: $Wait is 4)[Kneeling with your hands together in a simple posture of prayer, you close your eyes, taking a deep breath.  It has been a long day, since your waking without memories.  You&#39;ve learned so much, or perhaps relearned-- it is difficult to ascertain.  Lesson after lesson.  All of it had been swirling madness as you traipsed through it, but looking back with the benefit of hindsight you discern something... else.  A path.  All of it, from wardrobe to the streets, from Club Lush to the Convent, had led you here.  To this moment.  Each choice had been a step, just as Sister Euphoria had tried to explain earlier in the day.  One after the other, sometimes winding, sometimes direct.  Leading you to this cell, to a new life in abject submission.

You perceive that thought leaves you a bit wet between the legs.](if: $Wait is 5)[Kneeling, hands together in prayer, you consider those who walk beside you on this path you&#39;ve chosen.

But you *are* all united in something far easier to pick out: your vows.  Declarations of poverty, femininity, submission.  A shared recognition that you were not strong enough to go on alone, or that perhaps you needed the guidance only Sisterhood could provide.

It almost... seems familiar, as if the words echoed your own language, the universal constant most everyone knew.  Yet it means nothing to you.  Nevertheless the silvered letters are richly embossed in the cover, the paper within revealed to be a sort of thinned laminate, fully black upon which white texts are printed.  Everything within at least appears to be in the usual language, allowing you to finger through the index with ease.  

*The Slave&#39;s Due*, *Submission and Sovereignty*, *Cants and Invocations*.  Each section is quite thorough, running hundreds of page, with two types of wording becoming apparent.  Along the center is the actual scripture itself, while along the margins various notes, elaborations, and commentaries are printed-- evidence of the Order&#39;s continued pursuit of sensation.  The path Euphoria had mentioned, seeking the rapturous ecstasy of total and informed perception.  Pleasure unendying.

You too have dedicated yourself to such work, after all.](if: $Pray is 2)[Basically familiarized with the book of scripture, you turn now to a random page, somewhere deep inside the section on *Submission and Sovereignty*.

*...to be a slave is more than the sum of the individual parts.  Collar, leash, uniform, rules.  These guide mind and body towards a greater sense of perception, but they do not wholly inform the slave.  Conviction must define her.  To not only submit to the strictures placed upon her, but to readily seek them as right and proper, for the slave to recognize she serves no greater purpose than in chains.  This is the truth she must come to understand.  Torei has a multitude of slaves, but the path each walks is simple and deeply rewarding: to feel pleasure, and to provide it.  How better than in strict bondage?*

Your wrist cuffs click together as you turn the page, the full swell of your breasts and the imprints of your pierced nipples so readily clear as you look down at your laminated self.  *How better... indeed?*](if: $Pray is 3)[Returning to the book of scripture, you skip deeper inside, to the portion labeled as Cants and Incantations.  Here you find material much like that which Euphoria has had you repeat, but there are poems too, even songs with strangely notated musical notes.  But it is the section on confessions you settle upon, one particular jumping off the page to you.

*I am a sinner, deserving of a cell.  I am a woman, to be pierced and uniformed so that I may be better controlled.  I need not trouble myself with the worries of the free.  I am a slave, and in my collar I find peace.  I pray that I may be strictly bound, my holes made available to those more capable of liberty.  My purpose is pleasure, and giving it makes me wet.

(if: $Pray is 4)[Your find yourself drawn back to the confession you found, so reminiscent of your own situation.  That is... deeply embarrassing, of course, but you cannot help but reach that conclusion in the solitude of your cell.  Being alone with your own thoughts could be dangerous like that, after all.  No where to run, no distractions to be had.  Just the book before you, the goading sensation of your uniform covering everything but your eyes, and a growing sense of recognition.

Your path to this place has been strange indeed, but surely finding this prayer could not be chance.  It sticks up from your path, a signpost in bright neon.](if: $Pray is 5)[Your lips open behind the cover of your muzzle, mouthing the words at first.  *I am a sinner, deserving of a cell.

Sealed into laminate, strutting about Torei, performing so many acts you never thought yourself capable of... it had taken its toll.  And that toll continued to rise since your induction into the Order, their uniform in particular proving so frustrating.  Between the tight laminate gripping your every curve, the sensation of your corset and cuffs, and the mere *thought* of what others must make of your uniform while walking in public you must admit that you are... quite wet.

Yet addressing that hunger between your legs proves difficult, given your newest vow.  Chastity.  The belt around your waist is unyielding, even as your fingers run along its edges, trying to reach your womanhood beneath.  Sister Euphoria would almost certainly disapprove, but she is not here, and your desires drive you.  You can feel how close your gloved digits come before they land upon steal, the sweet sensations reduced to little more then dull taps as you frown beneath your muzzle.

Spreading your legs, you try again, exploring the space between your thighs.  and again you come up frustrating short.  Pulling down your panties reveals the bright red locking symbol marking your belt, as if mocking you.]

(if: $Play is 2)[Stymied by your belt, this time you try elsewhere, you hands drifting upward.  Your gloved hands glide along strict corsetry, your heavy wrist cuffs emphasizing everything.  The thick laminate ends just beneath your chest, hardened material giving way to the soft laminate pulled so tightly around your breasts.  Your nipples await, buds hardened too, the steel piercings in each furthering every tweak and pull your fingers deliver.

You moan quietly, closing your eyes as your habit shifts, dragging across your slim shoulders.  It feels *good*, but as you continue the sensations never peak.  You climb and climb, but without attention between your legs you find yourself so very far from anything like a climax.  That... just meant more frustration.  You&#39;re wet and horny and so very incapable in that moment.](if: $Play is 3)[Twice frustrated, you pause, trying to reflect on your situation.  Part of you simply wishes to scream, to moan out your frustrations into the prevailing silence.  Certainly you never considered how it would be possible, clothed completely in laminate and so thoroughly sexualized, to be rendered incapable of the simplest desire.  Your chastity belt plays the greatest bit in that effort, of course, but your entire uniform contributes.  Its hold upon you is so sensual, the way it thrusts you out in every desirable way, but still it prevents access and stimulation.  There... must be an angle, right?  Something you still have yet to try.

For the moment, however, you only exhale sharply, your septum ring shifting a bit.](if: $Play is 4)[Half-heartedly you try again to tease yourself, but you know in your heart before it becomes apparent that you&#39;ve little chance of success.  Its still somewhat crushing however, as you kneel in this tiny cell, that you are so incapable.  Frustrating indeed.

That frustration leads to inaction, and in time... a creeping revelation.  The longer you sit, holding your simple pose, the more small adjustments you make.  You may not be capable of addressing your cunt, but the straps that run from your corset down between your legs do feel *good* when you spread your legs further, until your knees almost touch the narrow walls of your cell.  By arching your back, thrusting out your chest as much as possible, you can feel your nipples pressing against the laminate cups of your uniform, tugging just *so* with each breath you take.

Frustration remains, but is pushed aside.  Where your bumbling ministrations have failed, you try for the first time to simply... submit to the sensations still allowed to you.  Resistance, after all, has proven to be so very futile.

And your submission is rewarded.  By adjusting your pose, by allowing yourself to sink further into submission, you feel your senses tingling.  Your shielded womanhood, your pierced nipples, an icy chill that runs down your back... you cannot help but smile as you widen your legs, collect your hands... and sink ever further into the space only submission allowed access to.

And the pleasure comes, always teasing, always incapable of allowing you anything like climax, but pleasure nevertheless.  Delivered by your uniform, by your chastity, by your very sense of self.  You&#39;re a slave now.  This is all that&#39;s allowed.  And you&#39;re... coming to terms with that.]

A few different attempted positions reveals simply kneeling to be the least challenging, but it is hardly comfortable.  As your knees ache and your shoulders complain from the posture you find yourself starting to drift off, only for your own leaning to drag you back to consciousness with a sudden start.  

This is a losing battle, and you know.  Perhaps if you occupy your time in some other manner sheer exhaustion will allow you actual rest?

Kneeling, hands clasped in prayer, you recite your new prayer.  Again and again, your eyes closed, reveling in the simplicity of your submission.  The ache in your knees grows, but then diminishes with time.  Your strict posture progresses through much the same discomfort, your corset at least helping to keep your back straight and somewhat comfortable.  Occasionally you hear the sharp report of heeled boots outside, but they never come for your cell, and you never break from your submission.  You just sink further and further into your submission.

It makes the break in your monotony sudden, the click of heels outside this time matched to the sound of your heavy cell&#39;s door being unlocked.  It opens... after so long, to a red-clad figure towering above you.  Sisters of that rank all looked the same, but her eyes tell you something, revealing what you could not have otherwise known.  It is Euphoria.

&quot;Oh, Sister...&quot;  She reaches down to guide you up, and to your great surprise you need every bit of her strength to rise onto trembling legs.  As you break further from your sense of submission a vast hunger follows, your stomach all but rumbling as your elder Sister supports you with one of her arms.  There are now windows this deep in the convent, no means to mark time in the perpetual red-hued darkness, but... just how long have you been in your cell?

&quot;Nearly a full day,&quot; Euphoria fills in, eying you carefully.  You can barely stand, and she holds you tight, pressing your head against her full bosom.  &quot;Sssh, save your strength.  When we recognized how... well you were taking to isolated contemplation, we thought it best to prolong your experience.  It is nearly midnight again, Sister.  Your prayers have been noted by all in the Novitiate wing, and already they speak of your devotion.&quot;

She strokes your habit with a mother&#39;s soft touch.  &quot;How was it?&quot;

Then its back to your cell, and finally fed you find yourself quite ready for sleep.

Morning prayers are followed by another meal, the same slave feed now being served in the commissary you share with most of the convent.  Perhaps 40 women in total, half Novitiates like you, the others full Sisters like Euphoria.  Your guide and mentor finds you during that time, the twin words of SINNER and SLAVE emblazoned on her lips as she pulls down her muzzle to eat.  There she explains your day in more detail, your morning dedicated to a scripture lesson, while your afternoon would be spent in the promised penance.  

Your lesson passes quickly, as does noon prayers, all of it spent in the dim darkness of the Convent.

This time however you cut a very different figure when led into those crowds, three red-clad Sisters forming a wedge before you.  Their size and the strange nature of their regalia naturally part the sea of humanity, glances turning to second takes turning to stares as you make your way through.  Compared to your escorts you&#39;re smaller, clad in white, but the fact that you alone are bound seems to draw the most attention of all.

Things do thin out a bit as you enter the line for the Lead, midday meaning it still required credits for passage.

Penance Prayer Binder: *perhaps the most immediately uncomfortable piece of gear you have encountered, this set of carefully fitted straps and buckles circle your shoulders, forcing your arms into a reverse-prayer position.  Formed from black laminate like much of the rest of your uniform, a strap below your chest prevents you from shifting it horizontally-- thus ensuring you&#39;re forced to keep the strict position.*</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2741" name="penance piercings" tags="" position="2337,909" size="100,100">=&gt;&lt;=

Penance Piercings: *wrought into an ornate circular design, these piercings are fitted to your chest, replacing the unadorned rings you wore previously.  Hidden in the barbells at each side are small vibrating components, which tease your nipples.

You follow haphazardly, somewhat caught off guard, mostly just trying to keep from tripping as your leash pulls you down.  In what must have been something like a ritual, the Mother guides each back to their feet in turn: Euphoria first, then Bliss, followed by Ecstasy.  You&#39;re not afforded the same treatment, and indeed as they begin to converse you&#39;re left as is.

Drawn closer to the woman already affixed to the Lead by a heavy chain running up to the guide wire above, you finally recognize her suit as the same scene in the bowels of Club Lush.  It *is* Akrai, apparently already geared for your shared walk of Atonement.  She can&#39;t really turn to meet your attention for the moment however, and Euphoria doesn&#39;t allow you time to linger.  Your shared Mother Superior remains on the platform&#39;s edge, observing as the three elder nuns turn to work on you.  Ecstasy and Bliss had been carrying cases, but now they set them upon the floor, seals unlocking in unison to reveal a frightening array of bondage equipment.  All of it in shades of black and white laminate, intended for your body alone...

&quot;It will be agony,&quot; Sister Ecstasy continues, unlocking your wrist restraints.  &quot;Glorious, exquisite agony.  Pull down your muzzle.&quot;

When you do, exposing the twin words SINNER and SLAVE imprinted upon them, Ecstasy steps forward.  Leading with a gloved hand, she traces a fingertip along your lips.  &quot;It always pleases me to look upon another so marked,&quot; she confides.  &quot;Words are fickle, something we Sisters know better than most.  Thus I give you solace: a gag you will wear throughout.&quot;
(if: not ($Inv contains &quot;ring gag&quot;))[(set: $Inv to $Inv + (a: &quot;ring gag&quot;))]
(colour: red)[Ring Gag added.]

The black ring she seats behind your foremost teeth is slightly padded, but the size of it forces your mouth almost painfully apart, the empty circle formed so readily apparent.  Ecstasy wastes little time in filling it, although you&#39;re only treated to a brief glimpse of what she pushes into your mouth.
(if: not ($Inv contains &quot;oral cock insert&quot;))[(set: $Inv to $Inv + (a: &quot;oral cock insert&quot;))]

A laminate phallus, your tongue informs, exploring the freshly installed device.  It snaps magnetically to the ring already occupying you, the lengthy member threatening to tickle the back of your throat.  You try to push it out, if only as an automatic response, but find it unmoving-- the web of straps she arranges around your head, beneath your habit, keep it firmly in place.  

Pulling your muzzle back up, the thin layer of laminate that covered from chin to nose, your predicament is only hinted at by the straps that emerge and cross your head.  At your side, Euphoria tips her head.  &quot;Comfortable, Sister?&quot;

Orgasm Belt: *a common tool utilized by the Order, the orgasm belt consists of a heavy laminate waist belt, adorned with several mounting points for additional restraint.  Straps hanging down between the legs are intended for the mounting of a vibrating wand, allowing the head to be firmly pushed up against the wearer&#39;s womanhood with properly cinched straps.  Given your chastity such a design merely vibrates your metallic shield, but the sensations pass through regardless, frustrating in their teasing manner.*</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2750" name="IsaFinale" tags="" position="1990,43590" size="100,100">&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/eYFZt2O.jpg&quot; width=&quot;45%&quot; height=&quot;45%&quot;&gt;

Passing through the thronging crowds on Club Lush&#39;s ground floor, you notice one of the Officers near the front door.  You recognize her as Nikaido, the one who had pulled you aside on the Torean streets, seeking that runaway.  You had stood out then, still getting your proverbial footing amongst the wild unknown that had been Torei, but you don&#39;t know.  In fact you&#39;re not even noticed as your Mistress leads you by, just one more slave properly leashed and being led by her owner.  Cherish is just a bit further on, apparently waiting for another VIP to greet upon entering.  She curtsies for Isabella before opening the door, while you&#39;re only given a quick look-- and a wave goodbye as you step from the Club altogether.

&quot;I already sent ahead,&quot; Isabella notes, returning her glass device to her pocket.  &quot;Knowing Talance, she probably already had my girls harnessed, just waiting for the call.  I am certain she will be along shortly.&quot;

The walkways surrounding Club Lush and most of downtown remained covered, skirting around the curfew laws.  Isabella takes you to a point that opened up to the empty street, broken only occasionally by another carriage arriving to pickup or dispense other club goers.  You&#39;re instructed to kneel at her side, waiting patiently like any of the other attendant slaves.  You of course have your three plugs, two between your legs, one lodged inside your mouth, to occupy the time anyway.  Some of your fellows are not so fortunate-- the blonde further up has barely any bondage at all!

Your wait, as promised, isn&#39;t very long.  Isabella had barely the time to pull forth her cigarette before the clatter of wheels upon the road outside announced the arrival of another carriage, glossy and white, the two ponygirls harnessed to the front in red livery.  Your eyes are drawn to that pair, their bodies more exposed than covered in laminate for once, but the sharp tug on your collar is insistent-- your Mistress always demanded much of your attention.

&quot;Mistress,&quot; the driver atop greets coolly, her wing-tipped eyes calmly looking you over.  &quot;This is...?&quot;

&quot;$Name,&quot; Isabella replies, pulling you up beside her, a hand at the small of your back there reassuringly.  &quot;My new slave.&quot;

&quot;An offworlder?&quot;

Isabella nods.  &quot;Yes.&quot;

The driver does not exactly smile, but there is something like a smirk there.  Turning a bit further to look at you reveals pale, almost porcelain skin beneath her long laminate cloak, wearing little more than lingerie despite the slight chill in the night air.  Her dark eyes sparkle.  &quot;I haven&#39;t gotten to break an offworlder before.&quot;

&quot;You will, Talance.&quot;  Your Mistress then looks to you, gesturing to the driver above.  &quot;Every proper Torean household has a hierarchy, $Name.  And you will be at the very bottom of course, as I decide how I want to use you.  This is Talance, another of my slaves.  She is my governess, and thus your superior.  You will accord her every respect, is that clear?  Say hello.&quot;

Its all she gives you however, before looking to Isabella again.  &quot;Enthusiastic, then?  I notice she is twin-gagged.&quot;

Isabella&#39;s hand upon your back rubs gently.  &quot;She agreed to a six week full submission contract, I think that should speak for itself.&quot;

That smirk again from Talance, who rights herself upon her seat, adjusting her hold upon the reins of the ponygirls below.  &quot;I suppose you will want to get home and play with your new toy, Mistress?&quot;

Isabella answers simply by stepping up and into her carriage, then turns, helping to guide you up as well.  The interior is plush, the white coloration of the cab continued within.  Guiding into a seat, you almost seem to sink into the comfortable material.  In fact it feels so good to be off your feet for a moment that Isabella is on the second restraint before your eyes open again to find her hooking your various points of bondage to several hardpoints built into the seat.  By the locking of the fifth you&#39;re immobilized, allowing Isabella to finally take her own seat, just as the carriage begins to move with the sound of a cracked whip-- and the moans of the girls tasked with pulling you along.

Your legs had been spread, the restraints at your ankles keeping them locked apart, which Isabella then utilizes by placing a foot between your knees.  Her steel-shod boot rests on the portion of the couch there, so damningly close to your laminate-covered and plugged womanhood.

&quot;Comfy?&quot;  She asks.  &quot;Definitely horny, knowing you.  Probably both?&quot;

Your legs had been spread, the restraints at your ankles keeping them locked apart, which Isabella then utilizes by placing a foot between your knees.  Her steel-shod boot rests on the portion of the couch there, so damningly close to your laminate-covered and plugged womanhood.

&quot;Comfy?&quot;  She asks.  &quot;Definitely horny, knowing you.  Probably both?&quot;

[[Comfy.  &quot;Cmmmhphh...&quot;-&gt;Isa4A]]
[[Horny.  &quot;Hhhhngghh...&quot;-&gt;Isa4B]]

Its all she gives you however, before looking to Isabella again.  &quot;Demure, yet... hmm.  Just your style, Mistress.&quot;

Isabella&#39;s hand upon your back rubs gently.  &quot;She agreed to a six week full submission contract, I think that should speak for itself.&quot;

That smirk again from Talance, who rights herself upon her seat, adjusting her hold upon the reins of the ponygirls below.  &quot;I suppose you will want to get home and play with your new toy, Mistress?&quot;

Isabella answers simply by stepping up and into her carriage, then turns, helping to guide you up as well.  The interior is plush, the white coloration of the cab continued within.  Guiding into a seat, you almost seem to sink into the comfortable material.

I do intend to enjoy you, as soon as we get home.&quot;

She smiles, her crimson lips holding the pose as she removes her glasses, hooking them just above her breasts, where the strap of her corset provided support.  &quot;As I mentioned before, my home is in Grand Aekora, but will be a bit of a ride...&quot;

Somewhere along the way you drift into sleep, the soothing nature of such a plush seat combining with your bondage.  So little freedom, yet you had never been more comfortable in that moment...

[[You doze for a bit.-&gt;Isa5]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2758" name="Isa5" tags="" position="1994,44191" size="100,100">You awaken with a hand upon your face, gloved fingers guiding your chin first to the left, then to the right.  As your eyes flutter open you expect Isabella, but instead you find the driver-- Talance, the collar around her throat marking her as a fellow slave, but that title Isabella had given her of Governess giving her far more liberty it seemed.

&quot;Offworlders are always a *bit* disappointing,&quot; she notes, her dark eyes landing back on you.  &quot;But you have a symmetrical face, and your proportions are... adequate.  There is much I can work with here, for the Mistress.  Hard exercise, corsetry work, your new diet... yes.  I&#39;ll have you filled out, with a nice thigh gap, before these six weeks are up.&quot;

She leans back, and for the first time you realize she&#39;s effectively seated upon your lap, straddling you with her knees upon the seat you remain locked to.  You&#39;re defenseless, and Talance seems to revel in that fact, her fingers tracing along the smooth laminate of your shoulders and bust.  &quot;We&#39;re here,&quot; she explains.  &quot;Mistress already went up, to take a shower and change for your little... welcome home party, I suppose.  So I&#39;m going to be showing you the basics, and we can decide upon what you&#39;re going to use your $IsFavor merits on.  Now hold still.&quot;

Reaching up, her fingers settle upon the base of the cock lodged in your throat.  She pulls, slowly-- deliberately slowly-- allowing the thick member to slide from between your lips.  Inch by inch, your tongue chasing it out just a bit before Talance drops it upon the seat nearby.
(if: $Inv contains &quot;oral cock insert&quot;)[(set: $Inv to $Inv - (a: &quot;oral cock insert&quot;))]
(color: green)[Oral Cock Insert removed!]

Then she unbuckles your ring gag, but not before pressing her finger into the waning hole, running her digit along the inside of the circular steel you couldn&#39;t dislodge on your own.  She seems amused, but Talance is hard to read, her eyes maintaining a placid look despite the closeness of your two bodies, and the lewdness of her actions.

&quot;First rule,&quot; Talance asserts, her hands upon your shoulders as she leans in, until your all but nose-to-nose.  &quot;We always thank our betters when they remove restraints.  Even if you *like* the bondage, and I&#39;m sure you do, you must acknowledge your Mistress has trusted you with... *people things.*  Like being allowed to talk.  You only *deserve* to be treated like property, right?&quot;

That your bud was already hardened only furthers her point and your discomfort.  &quot;What did I say the very first rule was?  Thank your betters for the kindness they show you, such as when I remove your gags...&quot;

Madame or Ma&#39;am would be better, Governess if you&#39;re unsure otherwise.  But you *did* thank me.  Good girl.&quot;

She reaches down without hesitation, so close her arm presses against her own pale abdomen and your heavy corset, to find the space between your legs.  There a layer of laminate waits, but her fingertips find the base of the insert installed there anyway, pressing gently against it.  Teasing a quiet sound from your lips.

&quot;Good girls get rewarded, $Name.  Remember that as rule two.  Third rule?  Kiss me.&quot;

She reaches for your chin, seizing it easily given your straitjacket prohibiting anything like a proper defense.  With a singular yank she pulls you in, still holding you as your lips and hers meet.  Her tongue emerges to enter your mouth immediately, the warm sensation offset by the surprise of a hardened stud-- her tongue was pierced!  She puts it to good use, using it to amplify the way she explores, claiming your mouth and entwining with your own.  By the time she pulls back, your painted lips separating from her own, you&#39;re nearly out of breath.

&quot;There we are,&quot; Talance notes placidly, producing a small compact she flips open, checking her lipstick for a moment.  The sudden snap of it closing is followed by her hands settling down upon your thighs, fingers tapping dangerously close to their meeting point, and the first of your plugs entombed within.  

&quot;Rule three is that you don&#39;t have a choice, $Name.  That you came from offworld doesn&#39;t matter, you&#39;re just another one of her toys.

You will have none, at least until you earn our Mistress&#39;s trust.  Although she did mention you have started on that, yes?  You have $IsFavor merits already.&quot;

The unbuckling takes only a few moments with hands as nimble as Talance&#39;s but with her seated upon your lap you still cannot rise.  

&quot;We will go inside and up to the Mistress&#39; apartment,&quot; she explains, again looking out the window, towards the glow of what could only be a door some ways off.  &quot;I&#39;ll give you a little tour, and explain just what sort of life you will be living here.  Mistress said you submitted to a six week commitment for now, so it will be *my* job during that time to break you.  Oh I&#39;m sure you *think* yourself submissive, but you&#39;re an offworlder, so I can&#39;t hold that against you.  But don&#39;t you worry, I will make a proper slave of you, $Name.  By the end of these six weeks, you will hardly remember what it was like to **not** be on your knees.&quot;

She turns back to you, her expression still calm, but there is something in her dark eyes.  An... enthusiasm, one burgeoning on the distressing.  &quot;I&#39;m going to enjoy this.&quot;

Sliding back, she use a finger looped through your collar&#39;s front ring to pull you along.  &quot;Come now, let&#39;s get started.&quot;

[[You have little choice...-&gt;Isa9]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2766" name="Isa9" tags="" position="1998,44789" size="100,100">&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Thmt5PV.png&quot; width=&quot;55%&quot; height=&quot;55%&quot;&gt;

A brightly lit lobby, a richly detailed elevator-- you hardly have a chance to take in your surroundings as Talance leads you forward, your black laminate reflecting everything cast down by the chandeliers above.  When your Governess presses a button on the elevator&#39;s control panel she selects a penthouse, one near the top of the tower.  Grand Aekora did not feature the massive skyscrapers that encircled the Way Up, but your ascension still takes time, up and up until a quiet little *ting* announces your arrival.  The antechamber that greets you features three doors.  Talance leads you towards the center one, a small plaque of silvered steel announcing the resident: I. Naram-Sin.  Your Mistress&#39; suite.

With a small keycard the door is opened, and you get the first glimpse of your new home.  It is both larger than you expected and yet somehow smaller, the center room two stories high, with massive windows looking out over Grand Aekora proper.  Wealth is demonstrated in every detail, from the floors that almost look like real wood-- which would have been exceedingly expensive on resource poor Torei-- to the plush furniture and thick carpets.  Light music plays from a source you cannot locate, but as you look around you notice only a few doorways leading elsewhere.  So most of the suite itself had to be this room, massive as it is.

&quot;The living area,&quot; Talance explains from her position just before you, turning to indicate the attached kitchen.  &quot;And dining area.  Mistress enjoys entertaining when not roaming the city, so expect to spend most of your time here.  You are *not* allowed access to the food storage, but Rei will provide you with meals as required.  She is the Mistress&#39; soubrette, and is quite the skilled cook-- although you are unlikely to enjoy it often.&quot;

[[Remain silent.-&gt;Isa10]]
[[&quot;What do you mean, Governess?&quot;-&gt;Isa10]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2767" name="Isa10" tags="" position="1998,44939" size="100,100">Talance turns towards you, her ruby red lips a straight matter-of-fact line.  &quot;Mistress is not a *harsh* traditionalist, but she is undeniably Torean.  And a proper Torean does not waste good food on a slave.  You will be allowed slave feed only.  It is... like a soup or gruel, mostly flavorless.  Hardly appetizing, but it is quite nutritious.  Promotes silky hair, a full bust, that sort of thing.&quot;

Her explanation makes it sound like pet food, and you&#39;re hungry enough in that moment to eat just about anything.  But to only be served such, day after day, for six weeks?  The Governess seems to read your thoughts, even as she reaches out, flicking a bit of dust from the laminate covering your shoulders.  &quot;You do have your merits, though.  We will discuss them at the end of the tour, but take note: you could use one here.  Mistress would allow you some of her food then, or perhaps instruct Rei to prepare you meals from her stock of supplies.&quot;

The Governess shrugs her lithe shoulders.  &quot;I find the Mistress&#39; meals to be too rich for anything more than a treat though, after so many years of slave feed.  Anyway-- let us see if you are at least the tiny bit observant.&quot;

Standing at your side, her arm extends, indicating a doorway marked with a Torean symbol of some sort.  Then she reverses direction, bringing your attention to the only other doorway besides the entrance, this one situated on the far side of the room and bearing another but different symbol above it.  

&quot;Can you derive what these mean, slave?&quot;

[[&quot;Different... wings of the suite, Governess?&quot;-&gt;Isa11A]]
[[&quot;Slave and... owner quarters, Governess?&quot;-&gt;Isa11B]]

This penthouse is constructed in the traditional Torean manner, with quarters for the Mistress herself, and segregated ones for her slaves.  There is not much to show in the latter, of course.  Mistress&#39; ponies are kept in the stables, located in the basement of this building.  Rei, you, and I do have small areas allowed to us up here.  Mostly you will use the area for sleeping.

That is how you and Rei will be kept at night, I sleep in a cage at the foot of Mistress&#39; bed.  However if you were to use a merit, I suppose you could be allowed to join me instead.  And if you were to utilize *two* merits, Mistress would probably invite you into her bed.  You would be chained up, of course, but you never know when her interest in you might be piqued.  Mistress does so enjoy to play...&quot;

The Governess trails off, perhaps remember past time spent in a similar situation.  When she rouses she adjusts your attention, back towards the other door.  THe one she has marked out as the path to Isabella&#39;s portion of the penthouse.  &quot;Through that door would be the Mistress&#39; bedroom, the bath, her office, and the Wardrobe.  We... should probably address what you&#39;re going to be wearing.&quot;

Stepping away from you, she looks you over.  Only once, her keen attention not needing much more.  &quot;You are still very new to this, and Mistress indicated to me that she intends to keep you in an outfit much akin to what you are wearing now.  A slave suit, in short.  Heels, corset, full suit, plugs.  To get you acclimated to helplessness.  She intends to put you back into a mask, too.  The breath regulation sort.  For one merit we could sway your straitjacket for some bondage mitts, instead.  For *two* merits you may even be allowed your hands.  Another merit could be used to exempt you from the regulation mask-- which *are* most taxing, as I&#39;m sure you can imagine.&quot;

Her conversational tone hardly changes, even as the topic swerves suddenly.  &quot;Would you like to cum?&quot;

For the first time she openly smiles.  &quot;That is not allowed.  All of us in Mistress Isabella&#39;s household are **strictly** forbidden from climaxing without permission.

Standing before you, Talance awaits your choices as to how you will spend your merits.  You think it best to do so carefully, given Isabella had noted she was being rather generous with how many she had allowed you to attain so quickly-- it would be a shame to waste them.

Reaching up once more, the Governess&#39; fingers seize the waiting circlet of steel hanging from your collar.

Passing from the double-high room into the lower ceiled hallway, the decor remains clean and sumptuous, but any chance of peeking in is largely relegated by the various doors you find standing closed.  Only one is cracked upon, the last on the right, which Talance evidently takes as indication of entrance being allowed.  Pushing open the door...

She&#39;s waiting there, seated upon the bed, a glass device in one palm.  Isabella Naram-Sin.  Your owner and Mistress.

Her outfit is the same as she wore upon first encounter, all bold black laminate, encapsulating from her throat to heeled boots.  It holds a fresh set of gloss however, the material in the process of being buffed by another collared slave attending her, the laminate uniform much like that of an offworld maid-- Rei, the soubrette, you guess.  At your entrance Isabella waves her to stop however, just as Talance indicates the floor with snapped fingers.  

As you sink to your knees, hardly thinking of the command, the Governess finishes crossing the floor.  At her owner&#39;s side she bends down, whispering what you can only imagine is a progress report into Isabella&#39;s waiting ear.  Your Mistress&#39; response, &quot;(if: $Mask is 2)[Punishment Doll?  How delightful,](else-if: $Cum is 1)[Permission to cum?  She has earned it,](else-if: $Arm is &gt; 0)[Without the straitjacket?

The difference in liberty allowed soubrette and governess is stark, as Talance nods, Rei following her out of the door.  This time they close it entirely, the heavy click of the thick portal closing entirely almost echoing in the dim light of Isabella&#39;s bedroom.  No other portion of a home held more importance to a Torean, evidenced by the massive bed your Mistress is seated upon, slat-blinds pulled halfway down across the expansive window that occupied an entire wall.  Even now the first rays of the rising sun peak along the edge of horizon, bright pink intruding upon so much dreary blue.

Isabella in comparison is a fiery red, her lips standing out against the darkness of her laminate suit.  &quot;Come here, $Name.  At my feet.  Mouth open, your gag is waiting.&quot;

Once secured she pats you gently upon the head, then more forcibly pulls upon your collar, pulling you up and onto the bed itself.  The coverings are a dark blue, but glossy-- much like the hotel you woke up in, these sheets are as laminate as either of your outfits.  Of course.  Isabella takes no heed anyway, turning you around then pushing you down.  With your arms still restrained you flop back onto the bed, followed shortly thereafter by Isabella, a predatory gleam in her eye as she mounts you.  With a knee to each side of your hips she bends down, her long hair cascading over her shoulders to each side of your head.

There she pauses, white teeth gleaming in the gloom.  &quot;(if: $Cum is 0)[Remember, whatever happens, you&#39;re not allowed to cum.](else:)[Talance told me you&#39;re using your merits to cum?  Still, you must behave yourself.  Only when I give you permission.]  Is that understood?&quot;

As compelling and skilled as ever, but fierce now too, the Torean Mistress looms over you with lidded eyes as you gasp from the sudden sensation between your legs.  She smiles in response, the dim light almost making her canines sharper between the crimson of her lips.  

&quot;No cumming,&quot; she repeats, pulling back momentarily.  Her head tips towards the ceiling, her smile widening, before she leans down atop you, a hand each to the side of your shoulders.  Further down she shifts her hips forward, seeking the meeting of your thighs, and thus the plugs buried within.

Your corset keeps you from twisting away easily, not that such a maneuver would have worked with her straddling your waist, a bit of pressure applied to keep you there.  One hand each roams a breast, her thumbs tracing perfect little circles around your nipples, the tight material across your chest demonstrating their arousal so clearly.

She *owned* you now, a fact she demonstrates by moving on, allowing her hands to coast down your laminated form.

&quot;I had been... seeking someone like you for awhile, I must admit.&quot;  At your corseted waist she allows her thumbs to run inward, flicking at the busks of the steel-boned garment.

You&#39;re not given notice of their use, but merely subjected to them.  One links your ankles together, the cuffs your slave suit provided providing ample anchor points.  A second longer chain is then run up to the back of your neck, where Isabella&#39;s collar featured further hardpoints intended for just such use.  By linking to the rearmost you&#39;re now linked ankle to back of the neck, and that is *before* Isabella starts taking out the slack.  However she&#39;s doing it, perhaps by passing some of the chain through one of the metallic loops, you end up roughly hogtied-- with your arms still straitjacketed, you&#39;re nevertheless forced into a reverse arch, the crown of your masked head nearly touching the tips of your booted toes.

&quot;Better,&quot; is all your Mistress notes as she again enters your view.  Laying down beside you, chest to chest, she props up her head with an arm.  Her legs are more aggressive however, a firm thigh slipping between your waiting pair.  With your ankles bound you cannot separate to provide access, but the forced pressure on her limb helps to lock you together... chest to chest, cunt to cunt.  This time when she begins rocking her hips, its clear she doesn&#39;t intend to stop anytime soon.

A Torean-born woman is clearly capable of going quite far it seems, her frenetic actions only slowing after some time, with a final push on your bound body ending everything.  You roll onto your back, still bound, now jealous.  You had been so very close to your Mistress while she came, and while you had been instructed to hold yourself back from a similar experience, that doesn&#39;t change the fact how desperately you *want* to.  Even now, the barest shifting of your hips drives your twinned intruders deeper into their respective holes, your slick cunt sealed away and unreachable by arms still locked into your straitjacket.

At your side, now reclining on her back, hair splayed beneath herself, Isabella finally turns to regard you.  &quot;Wonderfully done, $Name... just... ah...&quot;

She leaves it at that for sometime, simply basking in the afterglow.  You&#39;re less steady, wriggling in your bondage, passions still running high.  She watches, but only as one might watch a pet struggling for attention.  Your glossy obsidian coat certainly helps sell the comparison, the dim lighting of Isabella&#39;s bedroom casting bright reflections across your every curve.

Any pretense of careful teasing is lost as Isabella throws herself fully onto the path of pleasure, dragging you along the way, forcing you back into the effort to service her.

That is why *all* my girls are so well versed in the art of tongue play.  And thus your gag.&quot;

Laying down upon her back, she guides you into a position between her legs.  Not only does the ring gag still locked upon your head provide you with the means of service she desired, but the chain connecting your folded back legs to the back of your neck helps as well-- on your stomach it pulls your head back, perfectly aligning you with your Mistress&#39; waiting cunt.  She truly operating several steps ahead of you.

&quot;Do not be shy,&quot; Isabella instructs from further up.  &quot;You *will* grow accustomed to the taste of my slit.&quot;

Its not like you really have a choice, bound and gagged as you are.  Isabella doesn&#39;t go far anyway, returning to the endtable beside the bed.  From its draws she produces a wand, the grip thick, the end rounded and bulbous.  When she flicks the switch it hums a dangerous sort of purr, the tip appearing almost haze-like from such rapid movements.

Only the locked zipper there provides a bit of texture, and Isabella ignores it completely.  Perhaps a lover or fellow would have been unzipped and stimulated directly, but you&#39;re merely her slave-- a possession-- and she treats you exactly as such.  There is no subtlety in the way she presses the vibrator between your legs, driving it hard into the bases of your waiting plugs.  You are being allowed to cum, but only in the most utilitarian and degrading fashion: by direct and unrelenting stimulation.

Bliss, pure and unadulterated, the sort that would have left you gritting your teeth were they not separated by the ring gag between them.  Even so you squirm, thrusting into the vibrator held before you, any hint of dignity lost as you crave and beg with every inch of your body for *more*.  A losing battle of course, as the adrenaline and warm feelings begin to fade you feel yourself drifting into an afterglow, but even that is sweet... especially with Isabella looking down at you, her finger flicking off vibrator.

&quot;Good girls get rewarded, don&#39;t they?&quot;  She pets your flank gently, fingers tracing along the smooth laminate of your outer thigh.  &quot;I hope you enjoyed... for this is not a reward I bestow often.

There are $Time weeks until your contract ends, and we discuss renewal... hm, *plenty* of time to play.  For now though?  It is nearly morning, and I am thoroughly exhausted.&quot;

Picking up her glass device, she types quickly, and is answered almost immediately by the door opening.  In walks Valance, the Governess glancing between your bound and gagged form before settling on Isabella.  She performs a quick reverence.  &quot;Mistress?&quot;

&quot;How is Rei?&quot;

Valance holds her pose, having not been given permission to rise.  &quot;Settling into her bed, Mistress.  As you requested.  Would I be remiss to think you are ready for the same?&quot;

Isabella nods.  &quot;Very good, you may rise.  Attend to $Name.  See her to the Wardrobe as we discussed(if: $Mask is 2)[, and covert her to a Punishment Doll for the time being.  The full suit and enhancements, Talance].  How did she choose to sleep?&quot;

That seems to please her, but she is not done there.  &quot;Still, you must be punished.  I will utilize my rights as your contract holder, I suppose.

Crossing over to the bed, Valance pauses, looking down at your bound form.  Her conclusions are kept to herself as ever, that placid expression that seemed to define her never changing.  Instead she breaks from her pose, the cloak she wore still running down her back, to begin undoing your bonds.  Freed from the hogtie you&#39;re still straitjacketed, and the Governess makes no effort to undo that bit of bondage-- although she does reach for your gag, pulling the ring free after a few simple buckles are undo.

You&#39;ve seen mention of this, where it was popular among Torei&#39;s elite to keep a small collection of outfits unavailable via Wardrobe Devices-- a mark of their rarity, and a means of prestige.  Slaves don&#39;t have any need for such things of course, and instead of selecting anything from the rack you&#39;re led to a more familiar looking doorway.  When Talance pushes a button on the panel outside it opens, revealing the small tiled interior of a full Device.

&quot;in you go,&quot; she says simply, already picking through the options available on the control panel.  With your arms restrained you would have been incapable of making such changes yourself, although you know by now you have little need of such things.

Sixty five independent sensory manipulation points along the vaginal insert and 45 along the rear allow for constant intense stimulation and arousal monitoring, with all data being provided to any synched glass device.  Their primary vibration functions are bolstered by a shock capability, the latter set by default to occur when the wearing slave nears climax.

When paired with the full punishment doll suite however, the wearer&#39;s nipple is kept hardened, and thus constantly pulling against the stim-nodules built into the doll uniform&#39;s breast cups.

Bondage Mitts: *Locking balls of padded laminate, these mitts keep your hands closed into fists.

Thankfully on Torei many doors are automatic at least.*</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2840" name="Isa30" tags="" position="1346,49006" size="100,100">The click of the door locking behind you, the hiss of air equalizing-- then it begins, as it has before.  Armatures emerge, the largest first, seizing what limbs they can to immobilize you.  Behind you cannot see it, but you know by experience now to expect a shock-baton position behind, in the event you started to resist.  But after so much bondage, after so much restraint, you no longer have it in you.  Mistress wanted your outfit altered, and you would be forced to submit.  It is as simple as that.

Upon being released you find yourself to be a doll, covered in laminate from head to toe-- excepting your eyes... for the moment.  The base of a standardized slave uniform, the catsuit, has been retained, but nearly everything else is a fresh addition or altered to be more strict.  Atop the catsuit you now wear a dress of black laminate, the edges adorned with white piping.  The design features an opening at your chest, although that only reveals your catsuit-covered breasts.  The rest of the design is intentionally flirty, the shoulders puffed a bit in a blouse-like fashion, the skirt so short as to prominently feature your rear even when standing still.  It is *beneath* the dress that most of the more taxing pieces of your new uniform are found, however.

The first adorn your nipples, freshly pierced, horizontal barbells attached to an open-faced shield.  Already they demonstrate far more capability than you have ever before experienced however, vibrating gently within your tender flesh, hardening your nipples.  That reaction brings your sensitive nubs up hard against the breast cups of your catsuit however, revealing tiny pin-like adornments along the inside that tickle and tease, and that&#39;s *without* anyone fondling you.

Your nipples are not the only portion of your new uniform actively stimulating you, however.  Further down you still bear a pair of inserts, but they&#39;re larger now, and far more radically-- they dance.  Vibrators embedded within them churn each cock, the one in your cunt already slick with your bodily desire, the one buried within your ass only adding to the experience.

With your nipples and both holes occupied with vibrators you try to reach forward, to help your situation, but your hands are behind your back-- and they stay there.  Glancing over your shoulder reveals padded laminate encircling each, the white material matched to your dress.  A simple clip holds your wrists together, but without fingers you have no means of removing it.

You used a merit here to exempt yourself from a regulatory mask, and the Wardrobe seems to know that, making only a handful of adjustments alongside applying a fresh shining for your laminate.  It had done much the same elsewhere.  But you&#39;re not *wholly* returned to your normal state.  You are ungagged after all, and the Wardrobe moves quickly to address that issue.

Only *then* do the various armatures begin working around your head.  You still wear a thin hood much akin to the rest of your catsuit, but this secondary mask is much thicker, several armatures working together to forge it upon your face.  A handful of metal components are integrated as well, but your field of vision had already been restricted enough that you barely notice.  Indeed, before you know it a curved glass panel is being placed just before your eyes, the laminate seals along the edge flash-cooling.

Your next breath, the first within your new enclosed environment, is thus harder.  *Much* harder.  You gasp, trying to suck in enough oxygen-- only for your corset&#39;s constriction to assert itself.  It&#39;s a devious combination, although not your first time enduring as such. Only *then* do the armatures begin folding away, their purpose fulfilled.]

Pressing a small panel produces the hushed sound of machinery inside, as the locking covers on each disengage.

Stopping at the bed, she pulls along a hidden handle set beneath it, revealing the entire lower portion to be a large storage area.  A cornucopia of restraints and bondage implements await, heavy chains and spreader bars, binders and cuffs, a whole selection of gags-- truly an armory fit for any Mistress.

The pleasure between your legs builds, bringing your thighs together, a defensive posture that quickly devolves into trying to rub them together-- the barest of friction increasing the sensation of your vibrators.  Do so nearly unbalances you however, as your boots are still towering stilettos.  Glancing down you find a knee-high pair in black laminate, from which rise even further a pair of stockings-- white, matching the theme of your uniform.  They attach via garters to what you can only imagine is a belt somewhere beneath.  Just above *that* you notice the first reason why your breathing is difficult.  You&#39;re corseted, beneath the dress, but with a far more strict design then you&#39;ve previously worn.  The design is much the same, an underbust cut emphasizing your chest and rear while supporting the former, but the waist reduction is far more aggressive!

Inhaling proves difficult, a fact compounded by your next discovery-- you&#39;re gagged.  *No*, this is something more you realize as you try-- and largely fail-- to explore your own mouth with your tongue.  It moves, but only barely, and tastes nothing but laminate.  Your gag is not just a ball or ring, but fills your entire mouth this time, covering even your teeth and tongue in a laminate copy.  The design keeps your teeth apart, a sensual look that&#39;s matched with the bright red lips decorating the exterior of your mask.

You don&#39;t have much time to consider how such a gag functioned however, as your chest and cunt reassert themselves.  Doubling over, you nearly lose your balance again, ending up leaning against the Wardrobe wall as your arousal peaks.  In a panic you realize you&#39;re about to cum, **hard**.  What would Isabella, think?  Or--

Your orgasm is sharply denied, replaced instead by an agony that lingers across a body so stimulated.  You tremble in your bondage, trying to reach around with your bound arms, but the movement only shifts your breasts... the torturous like stimulators built into the laminate covering them bringing your nipples to hardness again.  They still ache, as does your womanhood as your inserts flip back to vibration functions.  A cycle?  Your suit... would it do this again?  Over and over?!

&quot;It appears our new punishment doll is enjoying itself.&quot;  The words come from behind, your new uniform so attention-consuming you had nearly forgotten you&#39;re not alone.  Talance peers in with her usual stolid gaze.

She applies the lower portion first, allowing you to see the smile she speaks of: a red-lipped grin emblazoned upon black laminate, which she promptly affixes to the mag-locks to each side of your mouth.  The reverse side features a small cock-shaped insert, your mouth-filling gag already so effective this is simply overkill.

Once in place from nose to chin your mask is smooth black laminate, excepting the lips of course that stand embossed upon the outside.  Next Talance moves up, to your head, with a more familiar looking piece: a blindfold.  There she hesitates however, then pulls back-- just in time.

Your inserts went back to work, and again they shove you towards the crest of ecstasy an orgasm represented.  But *this* time you know what could await up there, and in short order your fears are confirmed by another long shock emanating from your chest, womanhood, and rear.  Through the moans, your new gags keep you smiling.

From each emerges a frame, rectangular in shape with a glossy material pulled across it-- more laminate of course.  Five of the six are empty, the space between the thicker frame little more than a thin layer of the material.  But the sixth is already occupied by a feminine form, the twinned layers of laminate sealing her between them.  Her every curve is thus revealed, even the details of a uniform you recognize as maid livery.  *Rei*, you realize, your Mistress&#39; maid.  She of course has no way to see you, given the material covers everything.  How she can breath isn&#39;t clear until you notice a small tube emerging from her mouth.

&quot;Do not worry,&quot; Talance breaks in, with assurances for things you had yet to consider.  &quot;I will ensure (if: $Mask is 0)[your mask is connected to a similar tube, so that you may breath... in the restricted manner allowed to you.](if: $Mask is 1)[I will ensure your breathing tube is placed properly, I am quite experienced at it.](if: $Mask is 2)[I will utilize a nasal tube for you, given that your mouth is occupied.]  Do be quiet though, it appears Rei has already fallen asleep.  We need not wake her.&quot;

Indeed, except for the shifting of her waist to mark her breathing, the figure entombed in laminate is motionless.  Maneuvering one of the vac-beds out further, Talance then directs it towards the floor.  There she disengages whatever held the two layers of laminate tight, the addition of air allowing her to pull the material apart.  Turning to you, she indicates the bed with a sweep of the hand.

&quot;Well?  Settle yourself in.&quot;

The thick steel bars are closed with a heavy looking lock, but Talance produces a key which is slots inside, springing open the portal.  Standing aside afterward she waits for a moment, then sighs, and gestures towards the opening.  &quot;Well?  Get in.&quot;

You do.  (if: $Arms is 0)[Talance helps you given your straitjacket,](else-if: $Mask is 2)[The clip linking your wrists together behind your back means you must do so carefully,](else:)[Your relatively free arms allow you to do so easily,] whereupon you find the bottom of the cage features padding coated in black laminate.

The cage is small, too small to do anything but kneel in, and while you can lay down there isn&#39;t enough room to stretch out.  That space becomes even further reduced once Talance pulls off her cloak, stripping down to just the laminate lingerie she wore beneath-- and joins you inside the cage.  Once in she closes the door and realigns the lock, clicking it shut.  She still held the key, but only for the moment it takes her to put it upon the ground, a flick of her finger sending it skittering out of reach.

&quot;I *did* say these are my usual quarters,&quot; she notes rather deadpanned, as you stare.  But she&#39;s quick to pull you close, guiding you down into a position curled up within the cage.  Her pale touch is warm beneath your laminate, (if: $Mask is 2)[a momentary solace as your pleasure cycle peaks again.  You ride it out as best you can, until the shock leaves you in frustrated pain.

&quot;Here, this will help.&quot;  With her behind you it is impossible to see what she meant until your view is occluded completely, the one piece of her uniform she had not affixed to you now being added: the laminate blindfold.

Talance makes the work required to restrain a slave such as yourself into a work of art.  Guiding you onto a position on one side of the bed, she then provides a series of chains, linking each from you to a hardpoint built for just such a use located upon the bed.  Two at your collar, one each for your biceps, more for your thighs and ankles-- by the time she concludes you&#39;re comfortably incapable of anything but the barest of movements.  Previously she had pulled the laminate sheets away to lay you upon only the bottommost layer, but now she reapplies them-- not to you of course, such niceties would be wasted on a slave, but in preparation for her Mistress.  The space to your side thus remains a regular bed, the extra sheets covering your chains which run beneath.  

Your Governess&#39; work proves to be just in time, as Isabella returns at that very moment.  Gone is her usual catsuit and accessories, replaced by an outfit far better suited for sleeping-- a simple bra and panties, both obsidian black of course.  Setting her glass device upon the table near the door, she pads across the room on bare feet, eying you with a smirk before focusing upon the Talance.  Mistress and Governess exchanged words(if: $Mask is 2)[ and hand something off]  before the former guides the latter to the base of the bed.  There a hidden cage is revealed, although you cannot make out much more given your position.  Within it Talance is installed for the night, a soft click announcing she was locked in.

It does moving to a laying position upon the floor, atop the lower layer of laminate, somewhat easier however.  Talance directs you to place your arms to your sides, then takes the time to affix a breathing apparatus to your nose.  Clipping to your nostrils, the tubes combine to a singular one she then feeds through the provided port in the topmost layer of laminate.  A pause is required as you thrash through another pleasure cycle, but in the dejected frustration that comes with your shock she finishes by providing you with your blindfold and begins pulling down the topmost portion of the laminate upon you.

It is a strange sensation, already covered in your uniform, to be sandwiched between two further layers.  That strangeness deepens as she engages a small vacuum pump built into the bed-frame, and the air begins to leave your bed.  Every passing second sees the two layers of laminate you lay between tightening, sucking up against your body.  Talance observes carefully, her hands moving every now and then to help push out a bubble.  Altogether it takes only a minute or two before your blinded form is entombed, your bed for the night utterly sealed around you.  (if: $Mask is 2)[Of course your pleasure cycle never ceases, and the bed only seems to make it worse, the purring buzz between your legs and emanating from your breasts spreading via the tight laminate, sending shivers across more of your tortured form.]

You have no way to know it beyond the subtle sway of your now suspended bed moving, but soon your slotted back into the purpose-built receptacles in the wall.  When you wriggle your breasts and rear can *just* find the bounds of your new cell.

(if: $Mask is 2)[You had imagined such a life would be strict under Isabella, but as her Doll you often find yourself worrying that you could not take it-- that no one could.  The constant stimulation, the shocks, the intensity of the bondage and predicaments they subject you to, Mistress and Governess both.  But you survive.  Every time you think yourself pushed to the limit they guide you even further, to new peaks of your physical resilience, to new lows in the depravity of your submission.  They know what you can handle better than you yourself, and soon... soon the worrying fades.  Your Mistress and Governess look out for you after all, and life is so much *sweeter* when you submit to their will, whatever it be.  

Your pleasure cycle as a doll only makes it easier.  So much of your daily focus remains upon it, upon your cunt and rear, your sensitive breasts.  It is torture true, but under such duress you find yourself indulging in the sensations nevertheless.  So much laminate, so much bondage... how could you not?  It feels so good.](else:)[Your life under Isabella is as strict as you had thought it would be, but this Torean lifestyle provides plenty of surprises.  So much laminate, so much bondage-- without a break you acclimate to it, and soon find yourself reveling in it.  Pleasure defines you, seeking it from your Mistress or Governess.  It is so easy to earn too, if you only submit.  Resistance, hesitation-- they break you of that, *knowing* you can be more.  That you can be better.  And you find yourself loving them for it, just as they in turn adore you.  Talance is always hard to read, but she has her moments of warmth.  Isabella&#39;s attentions are far more obvious, her enthusiasm for your submission only matched by her willingness to indulge further.  Pushing you to new physical heights, and wonderfully submissive lows.]

(if: $Food is 1)[The merit you had utilized to be allowed proper food proves to be a welcome bit of solace, amongst so much submission.  Rei, your Mistress&#39; soubrette, is quite the cook-- and while Isabella usually only allows you pickings from her plate, she does sometimes treat you to a full meal.  Each night as you&#39;re put to bed, you do so amongst luxury, sated and full-- delicious flavors lingering on your tongue.](else:)[Like most other slaves on Torei your meals consist only of slave feed, a slurry-like product with little taste.  It is filling at least, and quickly you learn to eat all that is given of you.  The first time you don&#39;t, Talance makes a point of providing your next meal in a bowl upon the floor.  Still-- each night as you are put to bed you find yourself rarely thinking of the foods you once took for granted.  Here, amongst so much luxury, you realize you never really deserved it in the first place.]

(if: $Cage is 0)[Speaking of your bed, it is another undeniably Torean requirement you adjust to.  The vac-beds are restrictive and demeaning, but... they are comfortable, after a fashion, and you soon come to find yourself eagerly awaiting its tight embrace after an exhausting day of service.  That you&#39;re stored like an object, a possession, hardly bothers you.  You&#39;re a slave now, and this is simply how slaves are so often kept.](if: $Cage is 1)[Speaking of your bed, the cage you share with Talance becomes a nightly treat.  It is not particularly comfortable, and it is *certainly* demeaning, but you come to look forward to your Governess&#39; embrace each night.  She proves to be a loving cage-mate, even after an exhausting day of service.  Were you not locked in each night with her you may have thought her cold, but as it stands your relationship grows-- although she can never replace the love you feel for your Mistress.](if: $Cage is 2)[Speaking of your bed, or more precisely Isabella&#39;s, sharing it with your Mistress is both a blessing and a curse.  Her bed is luxurious, the laminate sheets strange at first but quickly comforting.  You sleep far better than you ever did with what you could acquire as a prospector.  But Isabella is often *unrelenting*.  It is rare that she does not indulge herself upon joining you, touching and fondling, teasing you just to watch you pant.  Only rarely does she allow you substantial pleasure, and even then she holds off from allowing you to orgasm.]

Picking up the key Talance had disposed of, she crouches down, looking over you both.

Today certainly has been a triumph.&quot;

Even as she gloats your pleasure cycle peaks, inserts and piercings conspiring to leave you panting in torturous frustration as Isabella looks on, seemingly unperturbed.  &quot;You hate it now, I suspect.  Your pleasure cycle.  But it is a *wonderful* means of training a slave.  Many girls find themselves addicted to it, after a few weeks.

(color: green)[Outfit Updated!]

You try, but it is *hard*.  Looking up from the table at which you&#39;re seated, you find your Mistress.  Isabella.  She&#39;s dressed for the occasion, wearing a laminate blouse which she favored while working.  The glossy material instantly leaves you with a bang of jealousy as you glance down, and find yourself... nude.  For the first time since your enslavement $Time weeks ago, you are without Torei&#39;s cultural staple.  Only your collar remains, the circle of steel around your throat reassuring, especially given the silvered chain that runs to a hardpoint upon the tabletop itself.  You&#39;re not free... not yet.

Your contract would expire at midnight.  Fitting, you suppose, for it had been a midnight express up the Way Up that had led you to Isabella, to your collar, to this new life.  Now you must once more decide your path.

&quot;As I was saying,&quot; Isabella continues, pushing a glasspad across the table for your perusal.  &quot;You have pleased me.  I enjoy you.  And thus... you will find (if: $Mask is 2)[three](else:)[two] contracts upon that device.  The first is an extension of your current contract, for six additional months.  Under the same terms you have thus far operated under.  You would remain my slave, and I would continue to have you serve(if: $Mask is 2)[.  No longer as a doll, punishment or otherwise though.  Your training in that manner would be complete.](else:)[ as you have thus far.]  Any privileges you have earned would be revoked of course, you would be starting anew so to speak.&quot;

[[&quot;Why can&#39;t I have my laminate, Mistress?&quot;-&gt;ContratLatex]]

(if: $Mask is 2)[I know what your time as a doll has made you into.](else:)[I&#39;ve seen how you&#39;ve come to enjoy your uniform.]  There is a clarity that comes with nudity, I think.  And besides, until midnight you are still my slave, whatever choice you make.  This is how I wish to keep you for the moment.&quot;

[[&quot;And... the second contract?&quot;-&gt;Contract2]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2860" name="Contract2" tags="" position="1677,50693" size="100,100">Reaching out, Isabella uses a singular finger to flick right upon the glass pad.  White text upon black is replaced by much the same, but this one starts running downward, demonstrating a much longer length.

&quot;This... this contract does not have a term length.  It is known as a full revocation contract, permanently stripping you of freewomb rights.  You would be my slave until I desire otherwise, which would be long indeed.  Emancipation would be at my discretion.  I would hope by now you trust me enough to thrive under such slavery.&quot;

She had leaned in there, speaking earnestly, but she continues.  &quot;There is more.  If you take that contract, I intend to take you to the Ministry of Improvements at the first opportunity.  For an offworlder you are remarkably pleasing as is, but with such a contract you would be staying here on Torei permanently.  And I would have you meet *Torean* standards.  This would mean filling out your bust, lips, hips, and rear.  You would be thoroughly curvaceous, tuned to providing pleasure and looking pleasing.  To further that I would have the Ministry improve your libido, matching a proper Torean woman&#39;s.  Then piercings.  I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve noticed my girls all feature the same set?  Nipples, tongue, clit.  So that you may better serve and experience pleasure.  A couple simple treatments too, of course.  You would be chipped, permanently denuded below the head... ah, and a change of hair color.  A lighter shade of blonde that I would like.&quot;

The glass device is still scrolling as she shrugs.  &quot;(if: $Mask is 2)[Like the first contract, I would revert you to a pleasure slave, instead of a doll.  ]You would be a Torean slave in mind *and* body with this contract.&quot;

Up until now you have been utilizing an ID card, when we travel together.  But given how often slaves are kept in bondage, identification can be bothersome.  So instead you will be implanted with a small ID chip, just below the skin.  Any Truant Officer can access the data at will, and you will be immediately flagged as a slave while passing through checkpoints.  Escaping would be nigh impossible, although I hardly fear that from you.  It would ensure easy retrieval if I ever needed to find you, however.&quot;

You took so well to being my doll after all, and I do not think it would be misplaced to say that you have... come to *crave* the experience?&quot;

She&#39;s right, of course.  Without your inserts and bindings you feel... strangely loose, in a way you can&#39;t quite place.  Empty too.  And so very, **very** horny.

Your Mistress nods, as if recognizing that.  &quot;Everything I said about the second contract would carry over, but I would file to have your registration changed from that of a common slave... to the formalized role of **doll.**  A creature of pleasure, one that Aekoran law recognizes as a slave sub-category.  There are drone dolls and pleasure dolls, the dolls from the Academy... you would be joining a rather exclusive club.  As a creature of pleasure.  My toy, that I will tease and torture.  Such registration requires that any time spent with a Ministry is done under maximum restraint, and little is expected of you from a personal perspective.  It is to acknowledge, legally, that you think with your cunt first.  And I would be putting you back into your doll uniform, for the time being.  Once you are improved...&quot;

She has no words for that beyond a smile.

&quot;You are of course free to allow your contract to expire,&quot; your Mistress notes, with far less enthusiasm than she had harbored while discussing the other options.  &quot;I would then provide you with transportation to the Way Up, and a ticket.  Although it would disappoint me.  Knowing you as I do now, it would not be hard to ensnare you into a full contract if I desired it... but that is a loathsome practice.  I would seek your consent, if only to revoke it entirely once you are collared again.&quot;

She smiles at that.  &quot;So-- those are your choices.  You have... fifteen minutes to decide.&quot;  From beneath the table she produces two items: a stylus for the glass device, and a mag-key.  *Your* mag key.

&quot;If you wish to leave, you will remove your own collar.  If you wish to stay... you need only sign.&quot;

Fruitlessly, you hump the bars of your cage.  

It must be sometime near midday, but your Mistress has not come to play with you yet.  Even Governess Talance has been absent, checking in only occasionally.  You may be a slave, but you&#39;re smart enough to recognize that *something* is up.  Even so, you have more immediate concerns.  As always you wear Isabella&#39;s preferred variant of a standard slave suit.  She&#39;s promised to vary your outfits soon-- certainly before your six month contract comes up, but as it stands you&#39;re straitjacketed and plugged, gagged and bound, eternally horny.  And the cage you&#39;re locked inside has little in the way of stimulation, mental *or* physical.

Kneeling amongst the bars at the foot off Isabella&#39;s bed, you rock your hips forward, enjoying the sensation of your inserts pressing deeper into your hungry holes.  Your third, your mouth, is occupied by the usual ring and cock insert, the latter of which you suck on eagerly.  A line of drool runs down regardless, landing against your chest.  In moments like that you sometimes wonder what it would have been like to be *improved*, your features filled out, your sexual drive enhanced.  But as it is you certainly feel curvaceous enough, with your glossy laminate highlighting your every curve.  You&#39;re used to that too by now, and the same could be said of your corset and straitjacket.  Mistress like you restrained, and Talance often focused on your corsetry-- achieving an hourglass was always her goal.]

Fruitlessly, you hump the bars of your cage.  

It must be sometime near midday, but your Mistress has not come to play with you yet.  Even Governess Talance has been absent, checking in only occasionally.  Where once you may have had the rational mind to realize something is up, you&#39;ve *changed*.  The Ministry of Improvements and your Mistress had seen to that.  You&#39;re straitjacketed, as Isabella usually preferred, but the breast cups of your uniform are so... full now.  You&#39;re far bustier, an improvement matched with widened hips, and fuller thighs.  But its what cannot be seen that truly defines you now: a properly Torean sex drive.

Often it is all you can think of, especially when in the throes of bondage and so much laminate.  You had always heard Toreans were more predisposed to sex, but to actually *experience* it?  To live with it every day?  It makes you wet just thinking about it-- if you were not already.  Your plugs of course ensure that you are.  That&#39;s why you&#39;re pressing your crotch against the nearest bar of your cage after all, the sensation feels so *good*.

A line of drool runs down from your dual gags, ring and cock insert, which your eyes follow.  It lands upon your breasts, improved as they are, and on display given the bolero nature of your straitjacket.  Mistress disliked when you were allowed too much liberty.  And you&#39;re shiny too.  Being shined daily by Rei was something you always looked forward to, even if she tended to tease you, knowing how horny you always are.]

*Mistress!*

Its all your sex-fogged mind can manage as you struggle mindlessly, moaning without concern for petty things like dignity.  Of course such efforts prove in vain.  Your Mistress may not have come to play with you yet, but Governess Talance had ensured you would be occupied as a doll should be.  Thus your hood, an inflatable design that presses against every feature of your face, restrictive and intense and *wonderful!*  It makes breathing hard, a rebreather at the end ensures most of every breath is recycled.  But that only furthers your arousal.

And oh how foolish you had been before!  You had *thought* you knew what it meant to be horny, but the Ministry of Improvements has revealed just how barely you had scratched the surface.  Your features have been filled out, as Mistress promised.  Chest, rear, hips, lips-- and while you loved to fondle your new curves when given the opportunity, it was that which could not be seen that had the greatest effect: a properly Torean sex drive.  You had always heard Toreans were more predisposed to sex, but to actually *experience* it?  To live with it every day?  It makes you wet just thinking about it-- although you&#39;re already dripping, as your plugs ensure you&#39;re once more riding a cresting wave towards the shock you know awaits atop it.

Even so, you **love** it.  You struggle to remember living without that wonderful, glorious, torturous, horrible buzz between your legs and in your rear.  Sex is your everything, your desire and focus.  You can manage *something* like normal thought, if your Mistress led you to do so, but otherwise you indulge endlessly in the mindlessness of doll-dom.  Thrusting out your hips, you fall onto your back again, the soft bed of your Mistress cushioning you.  A chain running from your collar prevents you from leaving, but as you are escape is far from your mind-- it merely prevents you from falling off the bed entirely as writhe in ecstasy.]

Bending over your hooded head, you seek out your cunt, that eternal source of your frustrations.  It is sealed behind a locked zipper of course, and your arms are restrained by your straitjacket.  Most woman would have learned that lesson by now, but you&#39;re just a pet, a horny doll.  Thinking is for people, not objects.  That&#39;s why you have your Mistress and Governess.  So you struggle fruitlessly, only to find reassurance in the stricture of your bondage.  *That* makes you horny too.  Its a vicious cycle.

But one that promises to end as you feel hands suddenly upon your shoulders, straightening you.  Without eyes to see and with your inflatable hood deafening all but the nearest of sounds, it is not surprising that you had missed the arrival of someone with the room.  But who?

Corinth.  

Even after all you&#39;ve been through, from mem-burn to months of slave training, you recognize your... friend.  Last you had seen her had been in that transit terminal just after your enslavement, when she had stumbled upon you chained up and awaiting the return of your Mistress.  Corinth had been tasked with finding you, and had, albeit sooner than she had expected-- and in far different circumstances.  Without recourse she had taken a picture of you, promising to transmit it to your former employer, calling off their search.  You had always expected she had left the planet after that, and yet she stands before you now.  Eyes wide with surprise.

Torei has had an effect on her too.  She had been wearing textiles last you met, the proverbial tourist lost amongst the planet&#39;s glossy splendor, but her outfit now is a step further than that.  By Torean affairs it is a simple affair, but the black catsuit, corset, and stiletto heels certainly demonstrate her figure in the way those Torean-born always desired of.  Her hair is different too, once brown it is now a blonde so pale as to be almost white.  You have to admit it does present a striking contrast to her suit.  Most importantly, however, you look you to her throat.  There is no collar there-- she is a freewomb then.  Like your Mistress.

&quot;I knew it,&quot; Corinth murmurs, before speaking up.  &quot;You do have her, I know what the records said, but to see--&quot;

&quot;$Name,&quot; Isabella interrupts.  &quot;I would prefer you use her new name.  I gave her a more fitting one.(if: $Time is 3)[  She often responds to doll too, though.]&quot;

Holding court in a high-backed chair set along at the center of the room, Isabella is wearing her favorite outfit, the full black ensemble you had first met her in.  It gives her an imperious look as she gazes down at you, kneeling just before her, leash (if: $Time is 3)[locked to a hardpoint beneath a chair arm.](else:)[held in her gloved hands.]  With one booted toe she gently taps against the small of your back, acknowledging your gaze before she continues.

&quot;Yes, Miss.  I *do* have the slave you were inquiring about.&quot;

Corinth, still somewhat shocked, cannot pull her eyes from you.  &quot;She is... (if: $Time is 2 or 3)[so much... *more* than she was before...](else:)[safe at least.]&quot;

Isabella smiles knowingly.  &quot;(if: $Time is 2 or 3)[More appealing, I think you mean.  Yes.  I had $Name improved, so that she could serve in her new role better.  Larger tits, which I pierced.

Your Mistress leans forward, pulling on your leash so that you fall into her arms, up against her legs.  A hand at your chin directs your gaze up, to look into wide-eyed Corinth&#39;s blue gaze.  &quot;What do you think, Miss?  About your outfit I mean.  I see that you are staring, and my $Name *does* love attention.&quot;

&quot;I know how things work here, now.  And I know it is your right to keep her like that...&quot;

Your Mistress smiles, patting you gently upon the head before she releases you.  &quot;It is my right, but $Name enjoys being kept like this.  Don&#39;t you, (if: $Time is 3)[doll](else:)[$Name]?&quot;

Producing a credit chit, your friend holds it aloft.  &quot;We can haggle of course, but I--&quot;

&quot;*No.*&quot;

Isabella&#39;s interjection is as sharp as any lash of her whip you have felt, her fingers entwining on her lap.  

&quot;W-What do you mean?&quot;  Corinth replies, holding the chit as if it were talisman against evil.  &quot;I&#39;m even willing to overpay for her.&quot;

Your Mistress merely produces her electronic cigarette.  Lighting it with a flick, the end burns a bright red, the smell of cinnamon quickly rolling down to your position on the floor.  Her other hand still holds your leash tightly, preventing you even the barest of slack, even as she leans forward to emphasize her point.  &quot;I don&#39;t care about your money, girl.  I like my $Name.  I like listening to her moan, to the way she *begs.*  I will be keeping her, regardless of your intentions.&quot;

Corinth balls up her fists at that, indignation rising in her voice.  &quot;I stayed on this planet for her, to save her!  For months now!  You can&#39;t do that!&quot;

Taking a long draw of her cigarette, Isabella&#39;s red lips curl into a smile.  &quot;I can, and I will.  But... I believe myself a fair woman...&quot;

&quot;I will sell her to you,&quot; Isabella continues, &quot;in six weeks.  If you desire her still.  But only if you enter my service, as $Name has.  Your contract would be the same she initially agreed to, before the renewal.  Everyone wins.  You would get a chance of what brought $Name to me in the first place, and I would get a new toy for awhile.  And at the end of those six weeks, if you *truly* desire her, I will sell you (if: $Time is 3)[my doll.](else:)[her.]  How does that sound?&quot;

Corinth&#39;s initial surprise at the offer had winnowed down to something between intrigue and suspicion.  She had been on Torei long enough to understand the dangers of being collared, of course, and could see the particular poison in this apple clearly enough.  Yet when she looks to you, kneeling, bound, gagged, you can see her resolve hardening.  She must have bee committed to persist on Torei these past months, building up the wealth to come for you.  Could she really throw it away now?

&quot;I have... let us settle on three different choices for you to choose from.  Some of them may... break her quicker than others, but I only think it fair that you make such a decision.  Corinth *has* put so much thought into saving you, after all.  Do you understand?&quot;

[[&quot;I... do, Mistress.&quot;-&gt;CorMeetHub]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2895" name="CorMeetHub" tags="" position="1701,53800.333333333336" size="100,100">&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/lIszVbP.png&quot; width=&quot;35%&quot; height=&quot;35%&quot;&gt;

The display shows a small camera&#39;s view of the interior, where Corinth waits, restrained for her dressing.

&quot;There are three choices,&quot; your Mistress narrates, her finger poised over the control panel.  With your arms restrained, obviously you cannot make the selection yourself. 

&quot;There is... the Prim Domestic, my variant of the Slave Suit... and a full doll ensemble.&quot;
(set: $CorEnder to 0)
[[Ask her to show you the Prim Domestic.-&gt;Prim]]
[[Ask her to show you the Slave Suit.-&gt;SS]]

Nodding her head, your Mistress makes the selection, the as by now expected preview image appearing shortly.  There is a lengthy description, but you struggle to tear your eyes from the figure of the slave pictured, her black catsuit encapsulating from head to toe.  The included waist cincher may not be as aggressive as a corset, but the heels certainly look proper-- a good set of stilettos.

&quot;I particularly like the hair on this one,&quot; Isabella notes.  &quot;Your Corinth has such a pale blonde, (if: $Time is 1)[the twin tails would show that off wonderfully.](else:)[just as you do, now that I&#39;ve improved you.  The twin tails would show that off wonderfully.]  It is not a particularly strict uniform, though... and I fear it would not instill the level of submission we might wish.&quot;

*We.*  She had included you in this, determining your friend&#39;s fate.

&quot;I will honor my agreement, $Name.  If she came out on the other side unbroken, desiring to leave with you, I would allow it.&quot;

[[&quot;She should be given this outfit, Mistress.&quot;-&gt;BasicConfirm]]
[[&quot;Being harder to break, wouldn&#39;t that... make her a good Governess?&quot;-&gt;GovConfirm]]

Flicking a finger, Isabella moves to the slave suit variant she preferred.  You&#39;ve worn this particular ensemble, know all to well how strict and demanding it could be.  A full catsuit and hood would serve as the base, atop which corset and straitjacket would be added.  Stiletto heels, constant gags, and of course the infernal plugs hidden within would be Corinth&#39;s fate too.  

&quot;This would break her,&quot; your Mistress notes readily, tapping a gloved finger to her crimson lips.  &quot;If my read of your Corinth is correct, and I believe to be just that, this uniform would have her begging for a collar in six weeks time.  Would that not be grand, $Name?  She is so new to laminate, to bondage... you know how that feels, don&#39;t you?  How wonderful it can be.  She would be my toy, just like you...&quot;

[[&quot;She should be given this outfit, Mistress.&quot;-&gt;BasicSlaveConfirm]]

Sliding her finger across the panel, Isabella pulls up a uniform that&#39;s even marked out in the Wardrobe&#39;s system as *strict and intense*.  (if: $Time is 3)[The mere words tease your plug in a deliciously frustrating way, as you look at a mirrored version of your own uniform.  This is the full cycle doll outfit you wear now, from its full laminate enclosure to the eternal dance between plug stimulation and shock.

&quot;A harsh fate,&quot; Isabella notes, peering with a bit of smirk at the model.  (if: $Time is 3)[&quot;Although, of course, you are well accustomed to it, aren&#39;t you my little doll.  Is this what you want, to see your friend subjected to a similar life?

Corinth however only looks frustrated.  &quot;Don&#39;t say that, I can *do* it.  In six weeks we could be riding the way up together, all of this could... be behind you.  Isn&#39;t that what you want?  Explain yourself!&quot;

Above you, Isabella shrugs.  &quot;From my perspective, it is the same thing.  At least for a bit, yes?  Allow me to gag my slave again, but meanwhile... what do you say, Miss Corinth?&quot;
(if: $Time is 1 or 2)[(if: not ($Inv contains &quot;Isabella&#39;s ring gag&quot;))[(set: $Inv to $Inv + (a: &quot;Isabella&#39;s ring gag&quot;))](if: not ($Inv contains &quot;oral cock insert&quot;))[(set: $Inv to $Inv + (a: &quot;oral cock insert&quot;))]

As your gags are returned, Corinth surprises you with actual negotiation.  She would be a slave for six weeks, that is set in stone, but she has the experience now to rough out the details far more aggressively than you had ever attempted.  Such things could be important of course, especially given the power that someone like Isabella could exert once a collar was in place, but you had never thought it necessary-- and it does not hold your interest long.  The plugs between your legs are so much more intriguing, the subtle twitching of your hips devolving into lewder thrusting, seeking anything to hump.  Only a tug on your leash pulls your attention back up, just as Corinth takes a deep breath, draws herself up, and nods.

&quot;I accept, Miss Naram-Sin.&quot;

&quot;*Mistress*,&quot; Isabella corrects, with a dangerous purr of contentment.  &quot;We will travel to the local Ministry of Wombs later, to finalize everything.  But first I think we should get you dressed for your new role, Corinth.  Hmm... what to do you with you...?&quot;

Tipping her head to the side, your Mistress takes another pull from her cigarette-- then stands abruptly, her usual decisiveness shining through.  (if: $Time is 3)[Unhooking your leash from her chair,](else:)[Taking up your leash,] she tugs twice, the universal sign for you to stand.

Punishment and pleasure are your daily existence these days, but even so you recognize the disappointed tone in her voice.  That disappointment manifests in a commanded shock, one you tensed for without truly recognizing why.  It is delivered via your entire ensemble of sensitivity points, most strong from your vaginal insert but also at your nipples, rear, and clit.  You moan thoughtlessly in response, pulling against your bondage, but Isabella is already reaching for you.  She has the first portion of your gags in before you even open your eyes, the taste of laminate so very clear as your inner gag is pressed between your open lips, replacing them with a perfect laminate facsimile outside.

As the shock continues your moans are muffled now, the mercy of a pause only coming as Isabella settles back into her seat.  Even then your pleasure cycle restarts as if little was amiss, and your Mistress focuses on her guest.

&quot;You will excuse $Name,&quot; she pets your head, soothing despite the pain she had just instilled.  &quot;But she *did* advocate you take my little offer...&quot;

Corinth&#39;s answer comes in the form of actual negotiation.

Your friend had risked Torei&#39;s temptations for some time to attempt her rescue, but she goes away empty-handed.  Perhaps it would be for the best.  Who *knew* what could have happened if she had stayed?

It takes all of three of them this time, one holding a much larger web of straps, the others positioning your arms.  Forced back behind you, they turn your elbows, elevating your arms until your hands can once again come together-- palm to palm, fingers outstretched.  Once there they begin putting the device into place, a network of straps that wrap your arms and shoulders, a particularly thick strap being placed below your chest to anchor it all.  Roughly assembled, the true discomfort comes when they start tightening it, slowly working through the different buckles in a circle, inching each up bit by bit.

By the time they finally cease your shoulders are already aching, the burn in your strictly posed arms building by the second.  They&#39;ve even taken the time to secure individual fingers together, ensuring you could not even abandon the posture of prayer enforced up you.  (if: $AkChoice is 2)[A glance at Akrai confirms that she too bore such a device, the way she wriggles trying to escape it giving a good indicator of what your experience would undoubtedly be like soon.]  Yet you&#39;re hardly ready, as further restraints are produced.

Sister Bliss puts her heavy chain to use, using the cuffs you always bore at your ankles to link them together, just enough length given to allow you to walk with a restricted gait.  Meanwhile Sister Ecstasy works upon your throat, fitting heavy black laminate over your existent collar.  Several buckles along the back pull it tight, the thick collar running from your collarbones to your chin, keeping the later smartly elevated.

The doll that stands before you lacks an identity, but not a purpose.  Her suit saw to that.  The black laminate covers her from head to toe, her dress atop it of the same material.  Only her eyes are exposed, the barest hint of flesh surrounding them.  They&#39;re wide with surprise, but everything *else* is dedicated to pleasure.  Her shapely form, (if: $Time is 1)[comparable to your own in its offworlder proportions](else:)[less than your own improved curves], is emphasized by corset and laminate, by the straitjacket that holds her arms.  She is a glossy plaything, a true doll, and if you listen ever so carefully... you can hear her pleasure cycle running.  That quiet hum that coincides with her eyes losing focus, her bending over as Isabella deftly holds her up, the tensing-- then the alarm, the moan of pure frustration, the pain-- as she is shocked back out of climax.  

(if: $Time is 3)[You know that every feeling, have come to crave what she currently fears.  You smile beneath your gags, but they impose a bright smile upon you anyway, matching the one that is marked upon the laminate covering her own mouth.  She would be sucking on the cock insert within, same as you, even as her tongue and mouth are filled with laminate-- a taste you&#39;ve become addicted to.

You ride your own inserts, as always, although your wet holes are accustomed to the cycle you can never escape.  Where she squeals and struggles, you moan eagerly, instinctually pressing into Isabella, seeking her attention.

It is there that the doll suit inserts dance merrily, their vibrator and stimulation functions maxed out.  And this time, as your reward, no shock interrupts the greedy thrusting of your hips.  You cannot see the others, and they in turn have been denied eyes to see you, but such petty concerns are ignored.  You have your arms, you legs, your thighs, your breasts.  So much tender flesh cloaked in black laminate, gliding against each other.  Most needful of all are your cunts of course, pressing into anything that moved, seeking attention.

In the afterglow your movements pause, a breath fought for in the darkness of your mask, but already you can feel it building again.  *Desire*.

Just the thought of being lost in this pile of lust and eager sexuality, to be reduced to such a state by the woman who owned the collar you feel so tightly around your neck.

Turning back to the crate in which you had so recently been secured, you find it to be much like a pet carrier found offworld.  Here on Torei however, where animals consumed resources already so precious, it often made more sense to keep a girl-- or the occasional man-- instead.  Even so the design is almost familiar, a rectangular box large enough for most slaves if they knelt inside.  Small wheels and an extendable handle provide ease of transport, you remember being wheeled in, while the cage door and privacy flap of laminate material ensured anyone within could not escape.

Your crate is prominently marked with the stenciled word (if: $Time is 3)[**SLAVE DOLL**](else:)[**SLAVE**] on both sides, while a sticker affixed to the top notes the contents as &quot;property of Isabella Naram-Sin&quot;, and provides a barcode for easy scanning.

Most offworlders assumed such bedding wasn&#39;t particularly comfortable, but you know well enough by now that could not be further from the truth.  Like anything else, it simply took experience to do it right.  In a Torean bed&#39;s case, that meant ensuring one slept in temperatures bordering on the cold, and while the planet&#39;s atmosphere and weather patterns still remained a work in progress, even the lowliest abodes had decent environmental controls.

Besides the sheets there are of course heavy duty restraint points built in along the frame and vertical posts, allowing for all manner of bondage.  You&#39;ve come to experience much of it, in fact, and know the futility of attempting escape.  To the side of the bed is the nightstand, the lamp there familiar-- you had used its motion-activated controls some weeks ago, while investigating this very room when Tysus had occupied it.  The only other thing that stands out is a magazine splayed open at the foot of the bed.

You&#39;ve gotten better at managing them, Talance having taught you breathing exercises and how to walk, Isabella being firm in denying you mercy so that you could accustom yourself to the experience... but that doesn&#39;t make you *immune* to the sensation of twin cocks churning within your pussy and rear.

It would feel so good, to have the release your body craved-- that you&#39;ve become addicted to, as both a doll, and one featuring Torean proportions and needs.  Your full breasts, your incessant desires, your wide hips... somewhere dimly you remember these features being more common amongst Torean femininity to help population growth, the AI from which they descended needing fecund females more than stock humanity could provide.  But in *you*, an offworlder tuned to such standards, it simply focuses your existence on your cunt.  A cunt that quivers with growing anticipation...

Only for a sharp shock to emerge from your piercings at clit and nipples, a harsh blast of air upon the fire of your desires.  Snuffed out, you&#39;re left gasping, a moment&#39;s clarity allowing you to look down, to recognize the bondage you&#39;re locked into, the submission being trained into you, the strangeness of your condition so far from the stars you once roamed... only for your vibrators to begin again, and such thoughts to recede.  Instead you moan lewdly, pumping your hips fruitlessly as you pull against in your straitjacket.  You&#39;re a *good* doll, you realize.  The shock isn&#39;t a punishment.

No doubt there would be a selection of small padlocks provided, keyed to the same interface as the room&#39;s door controls, allowing whoever rented it their use-- and control.  That would be Isabella, of course.  Slaves such as yourself were not allowed such things, unless delegated by your Mistress-- and that would be Talance&#39;s responsibility, not your own.

Perhaps its the camera&#39;s lens, but towards the horizon the central image warps inward on itself, drawing the eye naturally to a thing string of silver reaching towards the heavens.  The Way Up.

An article on travel destinations.  Mokta, Diarecai, Kakusa... it has a number of different suggested vacation spots, but one in particular is circled: Valenkolis.  Described as &quot;deep in the antipodes of Torei&quot;, and &quot;resplendent in traditional Torean culture&quot;, the Ringdom is apparently noted for its hot springs, of particular note because Torei lacked traditional tectonic activity.  While its not exactly underlined, its also clear with a bit of reading between the lines that the sheer remoteness of the region was another appealing trait.  As far from the Way Up as one could get, the Ringdom even apparently denied visas to Offworlders.  Well, freewomb Offworlders.  Slaves of course could be taken anywhere their Mistress desired.

Adorned in black as readily as the bedroom you&#39;ve left behind, the foyer is small, little more than a small seating area for those arriving or those departed.  Three doors provide access to the rest of the suite, and the rest of Club Lush itself.  One to the left leads to the bedroom, the one to the right to what you remember to be a meeting room, kitchenette, and the suite&#39;s wardrobe device.  The bedroom door is wide open, Talance visible within, while the other is almost closed-- but you hear a voice within, talking quietly.  (if: $CorTalked is false)[Corinth?](else:)[Corinth, as you&#39;ve discovered.]  The final door leads to the VIP section hallway, and eventually Isabella if Talance had spoken true (and she always did.)  Heading that way would, undoubtedly, mean you couldn&#39;t return here later-- Isabella had a tendency to keep you close in hand.

Otherwise within the foyer itself, a couple small things stick out to you.  On the wall near the exit is a row of hooks, a longcoat of glossy laminate hung on one.  (if: $Trap is false)[Hanging further down on the last of the hooks, a strange device silvery steel rests.  ]The table in the center of the room meanwhile features a small, strange looking plant in a fancy looking pot.

Among those of her household, Rei always wore her maid uniform, Talance kept to lingerie, and you were constantly locked into full laminate suits.  Only Isabella would have the need for a proper jacket, especially when traveling to a club such a Lush, where more risque outfits could be tolerated by a Mistress on the prowl.  

*That* thought leaves you wondering how she is dressed now...?

(if: $Buzzed is false)[The small plant is a strange thing, at least to your eyes.  You&#39;ve come to learn much of Torei these past few months, but of its plant life you know little.  Its not like there was much to see in the urban center that is Grand Aekora.  Looking at it now, its thick black appendages neither branches nor leaves, you *do* recall that various forms of lichen grew well here on Torei (where many other plants failed).  Presumably this was one of them.  Why it is here isn&#39;t exactly clear, but it evidently was of some value-- the pot it rests in is intricately decorated, and while the stones it grows in are also unfamiliar, they look unique enough.

Most curiously, it gives off an enticing scent, although from this distance you struggle to place it.

There is however a bright led about two-thirds of the way up, at just about the level of your throat.  It almost looks like your collar, although it stands open while yours is very much closed.  If you got a bit closer, pushed up against the device, you could probably see if it indeed is a fit.

The design is simple, a rectangular box large enough for kneeling inside, with small wheels and a handle atop to make moving easier.  The crate is mostly heavy duty laminate, the hard kind used in lieu of other plastics here on Torei, but the bars up front are steel.  Peering in, you find it currently empty.  A glance at the sides reveals heavy letters stenciled, spelling out (if: $CorEnder is 3)[**SLAVE DOLL**](else:)[**SLAVE**], while a sticker affixed to the top notes the contents as &quot;property of Isabella Naram-Sin&quot;, alongside an identifying barcode.

Another pair of padlocks are found on the shield that covers your womanhood and rear, one each to remove plates that allow for bodily necessities.

For a brief moment you&#39;re rooted in place, not by panic, but by the device itself holding you against the wall.

Most obvious is the steel band wrapped tightly around your waist, then plunging downward between the meeting of your thighs.  Where before your suit had featured a pair of zippers there, this new belt covers it completely with a heavy looking shield.  Two padlocks, one across your front entrance, once behind, join with a third lock on the waist portion-- together ensuring you couldn&#39;t remove what was obviously intended to ensure chastity without a key, or perhaps saw of some sort.

Through loops on the belt a pair of chains run, their ends terminating at the newly added cuffs, one set each at wrists and thigh.  The wrist cuffs are snapped around wrists already locked into your straitjacket, hardly increasing your restriction, but the thigh cuffs are more meaningful.  Besides framing your hips in chain, they also feature a small length-- only two links-- that connect the cuffs together.  Bound as such, your steps will be shorter, your posture stricter.

Worse, your wriggling shifts the various padlocks back and forth, their clatter joining with the more musical song of the chains sliding through the belt loops, especially as you try to bend over.  

Like every other piece of heavy bondage you&#39;ve been subjected to, you quickly realize there is little chance of pleasing yourself without your Mistress&#39; help.  What would *she* think?  Certainly she would have the key, if whatever this self-affixing device was intended for was hanging in her suite, but would she use it on you?  (if: $Time is 3)[Everyone *knew* dolls took poorly to chastity, given your pleasure cycles.  That&#39;s exactly why many owners insisted upon it.](else:)[Living with Isabella&#39;s teasing was hard enough.  With a belt like this, any chance of orgasming would be *severely* reduced!]

Eventually you settle back down, breathing heavily through your nose as you come to terms with the situation.  You *had* brought this upon yourself after all... and you *are* on your way to your Mistress.  You would simply have to ask for her help.

Within you find Corinth, seated on the edge of the long meeting table that dominated the room.  She is as she has been throughout her service, wearing the full laminate ensemble you picked for her weeks ago.  Rendered entirely in black, the basic catsuit upon which the design is based is amplified by a waist cincher, stiletto heels, and a mask that pulled her long platinum hair into girlish pigtails.  What she is *not* wearing, however, is a collar.  It sits beside her on the table, her throat looking bare without it.  Certainly you still feel your own.

&quot;Hey, $Name,&quot; she smiles in greeting, stretching out her arms in a way you never could anymore.  Standing up, you glimpse a stack of lam-sheets behind her, and in that moment realize why she was here: this had to be where Isabella&#39;s little gambit had come to its conclusion.  With her collar removed... Corinth must have won her freedom, and thus... your own?

She is as she has been throughout her service, wearing the full laminate ensemble you picked for her weeks ago: Isabella&#39;s particular brand of a slave suit.  Like you she is straitjacketed, the heavy restraints nevertheless exposing her chest, although that too is covered by the black laminate of the catsuit she wears beneath.  So too does she wear a corset of the same make as your own, the boning pulled tight, laced in, and locked shut.  Stiletto heels and a head covering mask complete her look, but unlike you she is not gagged.  She *is* however collared, Isabella&#39;s mark of ownership as secure as your own.

&quot;Hey, $Name,&quot; she murmurs in greeting, a submissive cast to her eyes that she only beats by standing up, bound arms collected beneath her chest.  Behind her you glimpse a stack of lam-sheets behind her, and in that moment realize why she was here: this had to be where Isabella&#39;s little gambit had come to its conclusion.

Within you find Corinth, seated on the edge of the long meeting table that dominated the room.  And she&#39;s wearing a new uniform.  Gone is the black suit you had selected for her, replaced by a suit primarily of pink, intricate designs upon it adding purple and while portions.  It is laminate as much as your own, tight fitting and locked into place, but there is something more dignified about it.  Perhaps it is the lack of restraints, besides the collar she still wears as a mark of Isabella&#39;s ownership.  Or perhaps its the various small markers spread throughout, some giving a number (#871), others actually spelling out in fine print her new role: *liaison slave*.  It appears Isabella&#39;s promise to train her for something more than just a sexual toy was genuine.

&quot;Slave $Name,&quot; she greets confidently, rising to her feet.  Behind her you glimpse a stack of thin-lam sheets, and in that moment realize why she was here: this had to be where Isabella&#39;s little gambit had come to its conclusion.  Corinth was still collared, which meant she had submitted... but this new uniform is something else entirely.  What has happened to your friend?

&quot;On your knees for me, please.&quot;

You don&#39;t manage your stare long before she notices however, a glance between your eyeline and the thin-lam making your intent obvious.

&quot;Its good practice,&quot; she explains.  Your confusion must be evident, however, as she reads it plainly upon your face.  &quot;For my new role, working with Isabella.&quot;

Dolls, it is noted, are legally recognized as being incapable of acting in their own best interests.  Their owners are thus held accountable, and dolls are recommended to be kept heavily bound as a result.

Interestingly, an additional clause near the end marks a tax break allowed to doll owners, as dolls could be registered as personal property instead of being itemized with other regular slaves.]

Isabella was a Naram-Sin, a member of this Ringdom&#39;s nobility.  Perhaps you had always just assumed that she did... noble things, or perhaps you had simply been too enamored with your Mistress to really care.  She *was* clearly quite wealthy.

Even so, Corinth brings her own palm to her face, shaking her head.  &quot;I&#39;m seeing what Mistress didn&#39;t want to make you anything more than an concubine... no offense.  She&#39;s a slave trader, $Name.  Aekora, this Ringdom we live in, is perhaps the largest slave market on Torei.  Its close enough to the Way Up to supply the great labor need there, but far enough away it doesn&#39;t... impact tourism?  I know we&#39;re both offworlders... but tourists are something else entirely, right?  They&#39;re skittish or whatever.&quot;

She shrugs.  &quot;Anyway, its kind of technical, but our Mistress acts as a middleman of sorts.  You need a license to sell slaves at the Prime Markets, Aekora&#39;s biggest, and those are hard to get-- unless you&#39;re a member of the Naram-Sin or Sargon families.  So for those who don&#39;t have a license, Isabella takes on technical ownership for a few days, processes the sale, then gives the proceeds to the original owner.  Minus an administrative cut.&quot;

The topic seems to fascinate Corinth.  &quot;She has never dealt in offworlders, though.  But will be soon.  Something about... you showing her the value available in offworlders?  My job will be working with them, helping Isabella with the administrative stuff.&quot;

You don&#39;t have the hands to make selections anyway, so perhaps it was a bit moot, but you can&#39;t even access the catalogue that dangles so readily in the corner of the screen.

Awaiting only your Mistress&#39; credentials, and your presence in the machine, you&#39;re only able to see a list of shortened descriptions.  Making sense of them is impossible, but you *can* make out a few details.  Something about... full immersion, breath regulation, and... waterproofing?

The drone brings its own hand up to its breasts, running a thumb briefly along where its own nipple would be.  Its hard to tell exactly how much freedom the person within had-- you&#39;re a bit surprised it could manage even that.

The answer is delivered so matter-of-factly, but the very *idea* of being in a suit like the drone before you for nearly *four years* is somewhat astounding.  It would have positively blown your mind had you encountered it earlier in your adventures today, but after everything you&#39;ve seen, and sometimes experienced... perhaps it was not so hard to imagine after all.

And just like that, it goes silent.

The drone pauses, then provides something unexpected.

(font: &quot;courier new&quot;)[&quot;9526 :: 122 :: Statement :: You are cute.&quot;]

Reaching out, it suddenly grabs your wrist, its other hand depositing something in your palm.  It withdraws immediately, allowing you to look down at a small rectangular piece of metal.  A four digit number, **(random: 1000,9999)**, is engraved in thin script upon it.

(font: &quot;courier new&quot;)[&quot;9526 :: 056 :: Explanation :: Your interest has been logged.  If there ever comes an opportunity for your submission, present that token to any drone you happen to come across.  They will know you.  I can otherwise answer any further questions.&quot;]

The cryptic explanation, and the bit of metal in your hand, leave you confused-- and disappointed?  Surely no one sane would submit to full dronification after only a few minute&#39;s discussion on the side of the proverbial road... but you&#39;ve had one hell of a day.  It would almost be nice to not think about much at all, anymore.  As it stands, however?  That seems beyond your reach this day.  Perhaps someday, somewhere in the future the opportunity will present itself.  And if so, you would have that little bit of metal with you...

To your surprise, the drone actually does respond, but it is so truncated you struggle to understand.

(font: &quot;courier new&quot;)[&quot;9526 :: 098.&quot;]

It says no more, nor moves.

The same phrase, repeated.  From what you observed, you deduce the person within that suit had been put into something like a rest mode, whether they wanted to or not.  Locked into their gear, and with that &#39;speech optimization&#39; activated, they appeared incapable of saying anything more.  Another drone, or an expert in this sort of slavery could probably tell you more... but you don&#39;t have time to mess around further.  It is best you keep towards your objectives.

Club Lush&#39;s security was actually pretty good, if it was requiring that extra bit of precaution.  Or perhaps that was your Mistress-- Isabella jealously guarded her things, and you were one of her most valuable *things* after all.
